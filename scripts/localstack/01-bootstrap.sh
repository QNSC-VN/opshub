# environment.
#
# Names / region are kept in sync with .env (S3_FILES_BUCKET).

# content-type, content-length and content-disposition, and returns all of them
# in `requiredHeaders` for the client to send. The comment that used to sit here
# claimed Content-Type was the only signed header; it was wrong, so the preflight
# refused Content-Disposition and every browser upload died with an opaque
# `net::ERR_FAILED` — no status, no CORS headers, nothing to read. Measured from a
# real browser, and the same gap was in infra/modules/stack/main.tf.
#
# Content-Length stays off the list deliberately: the browser sets it itself and it
# is a forbidden header name, so CORS never governs it.
