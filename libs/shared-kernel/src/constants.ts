 * and the §9.3 agenda can ever see, spelled out ten times. Changing what a report will show meant finding
 * all ten and hoping.
 *
 * WHY 200 AND NOT UNBOUNDED. A report is read to decide something. Two hundred overdue rows is already a
 * finding about the process rather than a list to work through, and every one of these reports feeds an
 * agenda item that samples the first handful anyway.
 *
 * Reports that deliberately return FEWER say so at the call site with their own reason.

//
// This file previously declared its own PERMISSION map with a DIFFERENT

// Deliberately NOT here either — and for exactly the reason described just above

//
// A 40-key `AUDIT_ACTION` used to live here alongside the real 181-key catalogue in
// `@modules/audit` (`domain/audit-catalogue.ts`). Nothing imported this one; every
// service reaches for `@modules/audit`. But `shared-kernel` is re-exported
// wholesale, so `import { AUDIT_ACTION } from '@shared-kernel'` silently resolved to
// the smaller, staler set — one autocomplete away, again.
//
// It was not merely redundant. Four keys carried DIFFERENT VALUES for the same event
// (`catalog.item_created` here against `catalog_item.created` there), and the seven
// `RBAC_*` keys duplicated `role.*` and `delegation.*` under another name. Writing
// one and querying the other loses rows from the trail, and nothing fails.
//
// `test/audit-catalogue-single-source.spec.ts` keeps a third copy from appearing.
