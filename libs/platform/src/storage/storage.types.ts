/**
 * Storage types — upload policy descriptors, DTOs, and lifecycle constants.
 *
 * ONE DESCRIPTOR PER UPLOAD SURFACE, and the surface name is the key prefix every object of
 * that kind lives under. `StorageService` enforces the descriptor; the owning module enforces
 * authorization. That split is the point: the mechanics (key layout, presign, checksum,
 * size/MIME/quota gates, confirm, reap) are identical everywhere, while "may this actor attach
 * to this thing?" depends on the owning context's permission model.
 *
 * Adding a surface is a descriptor here plus, for multi-file surfaces, a link row in
 * `storage.attachments`. It is never a change to `StorageService`.
 *
 * Ported from rally's `attachment-policy.ts`, which reached this shape after every new upload
 * surface had produced another copy of presign/confirm.
 *
 *   - allowedMimeTypes    — checked against the client-declared Content-Type
 *   - maxSizeBytes        — client declares size; HeadObject verifies it on confirm
 *   - maxPerOwner         — completed files per owning entity; `null` for the 1:1 surfaces that
 *                           replace rather than accumulate
 *   - inlineDisposition   — may the browser RENDER this, or must it always download?
 *
 * SVG IS EXCLUDED FROM EVERY POLICY, deliberately and permanently. It is an active-content
 * format (inline `<script>`, `foreignObject`, external refs), so an "image" upload becomes
 * stored XSS the moment the bytes are served from an origin the app trusts — which is exactly
 * what `CDN_FILES_BASE_URL` does. A surface that must render inline pays for it by accepting
 * raster only.
