/**
 * Attachment mechanics for any entity that can own several files.
 *
 * MECHANICS HERE, AUTHORIZATION IN THE OWNING MODULE — rally's split, and the reason it exists:
 * the key layout, the quota, presign, confirm and unlink are identical for every surface, while
 * "may this actor attach to this thing?" depends on the owning context's permission model. So this
 * service never resolves a permission from an entity type and never loads a training record. Its
 * callers prove the subject exists, prove the actor may touch it, and delegate here.
 *
 * That is deliberate rather than lazy: an `entityType → permission` map inside here is exactly
 * where cross-entity authorization bugs hide — a new surface added to the map inherits whatever
 * the nearest entry happened to require.
 *
 * WHY THE QUOTA IS CHECKED TWICE. Presign reserves a row; confirm is where the file becomes
 * visible. N concurrent presigns can each pass a check against the same count, so the limit has to
 * hold at the point of visibility, and a file that arrives over the line is discarded rather than
 * linked.
