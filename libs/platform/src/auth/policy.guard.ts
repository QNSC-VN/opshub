/**
 * Permission guard — enforces the fine-grained permission declared via
 * @RequirePermission(...). Runs after JwtAuthGuard, so request.user is set.
 *
 * DENIES A ROUTE THAT DECLARED NOTHING. This used to `return true` on missing metadata, so a
 * handler nobody decorated was open to every authenticated caller: `JwtAuthGuard` proved who
 * you were and then nothing checked whether you may. 43 handlers were in that state, and a
 * new one was a silently world-readable endpoint that every test still passed.
 *
 * A route that genuinely needs no permission code now says which of the two real reasons
 * applies — `@SelfScoped` or `@AuthorizedInService` — so "no code" and "nobody decided" stop
 * looking identical.
 *
 * THIS IS DEFENCE IN DEPTH, NOT THE PRIMARY GATE. The guard only runs where it is mounted,
 * and `@Public()` / a bare `@Auth()` do not mount it — so a forgotten decorator would never
 * reach this code at all. `assertEveryRouteDeclaresAuthz` is the real enforcement: it refuses
 * to BOOT on an undeclared route, which catches it at deploy rather than when someone probes
 * the endpoint. Resolution is delegated to {@link AuthzService}, which fails closed on
 * cache/DB errors.
