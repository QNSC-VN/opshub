 *                                `?employeeId=…` IS the owner.

 *                                and derive its attributes.
 *
 * This replaced a `scopeFrom: (req) => ResourceAttrs` callback. The callback was
 * strictly more powerful and never used once — and a per-route closure cannot be
 * checked, listed, or reviewed in bulk, which is exactly what an authorization
 * surface needs.
