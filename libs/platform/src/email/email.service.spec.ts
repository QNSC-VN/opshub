/**
 * The sender and reply-to addresses, which are the two things a misconfigured mail setup gets wrong
 * silently.
 *
 * `MAIL_REPLY_TO` was declared in the env schema, listed in `.env.example`, and read by nothing. The
 * provider interface carried `replyTo` and `sendTemplate` accepted it per call, so the plumbing existed
 * end to end — no caller ever passed one and nothing supplied a default. An operator setting a reply-to
 * address got mail without one, and replies went back to a `no-reply` sender.
 *
 * So the properties worth pinning are about PRECEDENCE, not about whether a header is set: the
 * deployment-wide default must apply when nobody asks, and must lose when somebody does.
