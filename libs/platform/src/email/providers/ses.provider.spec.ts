/**
 * What the SES provider actually puts on the wire.
 *
 * The interesting properties are all about the shape of the command, because that is where a mail
 * transport fails quietly. An unverified sender is refused outright by SES, but a missing plaintext
 * alternative, an unset configuration set or a dropped reply-to all send successfully and cost
 * something later — deliverability, attribution, or a reply nobody receives.
 *
 * The SDK client is stubbed rather than the module mocked: what matters is the exact command handed to
 * `send`, and a stub lets the assertions be about that.
