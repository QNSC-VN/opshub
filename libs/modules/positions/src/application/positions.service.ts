/**
 * Positions, approved headcount, and occupancy over time.
 *
 * TWO RULES THIS SERVICE OWNS, because the database cannot.
 *
 * 1. HEADCOUNT. "At most `headcount` people hold this position at once" is a count across rows
 *    filtered by `effective_to IS NULL` — not expressible as a unique index, and invisible to a
 *    CHECK constraint, which cannot see other rows. So it is counted here, INSIDE the assignment
 *    transaction: read on the pool instead and two concurrent assignments both see the last free
 *    slot and both take it.
 *
 * 2. TRANSFER IS ONE ACT. Moving someone closes the old assignment and opens the new one in a
 *    single transaction, in that order. The order is forced by
 *    `uq_employee_current_position`: opening first hits the index, which is the intended
 *    behaviour rather than an obstacle — it means a transfer cannot half-happen.
