 * every route that could turn a `positionId` into a title needs `position.read`, which a plain employee
 * does not hold. So the self-service answer was a list of UUIDs the caller had no way to resolve, which is
 * the same "nobody knows a UUID" problem the SPA's `EntityPicker` exists to remove.
 *
 * A SEPARATE TYPE FROM `EmployeePosition`, not extra optional fields on it: `listAssignmentsForPosition`
 * answers the other direction — who held THIS position — where the title is the thing the caller already
 * had. Optional fields would make every reader check which query it came from.
