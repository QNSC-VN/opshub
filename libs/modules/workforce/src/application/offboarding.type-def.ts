 * Single-step offboarding workflow (HR approves).
 *
 * `onApprove` atomically:
 *   1. Sets employee status → `offboarded`
 *   2. Removes all RBAC role assignments, and clears the cached role claims with them
 *   3. Revokes all active access grants
 *   4. Returns all assigned hardware assets (sets returnedAt, status → in_stock)
 *   5. Revokes all active refresh tokens (forces immediate logout)
 *
 * All five operations share the same transaction, so either all succeed or none do.
 *
 * EVERY REMOVAL IS AUDITED, AND THAT WAS THE DEFECT. This hook wrote all five steps and recorded
 * NOTHING — no `role.revoked`, no `access_grant.revoked`, no `asset.unassigned` — because it writes
 * the tables directly instead of going through the services that own them, and those services are
 * where the audit calls live. Every one of those events is audited when a person does it by hand, so
 * an access-removal review saw a leaver whose privileges vanished with no record of who took them or
 * when. That is precisely the evidence ISO 27001 A.8 asks for, on the one path that most needs it.
 *
 * The entries use the SAME action codes and resource types the owning services use, so the trail
 * reads identically whether access was removed one row at a time or by this workflow.
 *
 * STILL A LAYER VIOLATION: the writes belong to `AuthzAdminService`, `AssetService`,
 * `AccessRequestService` and the refresh-token repository, and each of those exposes only a
 * transaction-OWNING method, which cannot be called from inside the engine's `tx` without nesting.
 * The fix is a `tx`-accepting method on each, the way `RiskAcceptanceTypeDef` calls
 * `RisksService.applyAcceptance(..., tx)`. That is a wider change than the missing evidence, so it is
 * left for its own commit; this one closes the audit and cache holes.

   * the line after its transaction. This hook did not, so for up to five minutes after being

   * session was revoked, but an access token already in hand keeps working until it expires.

   * AFTER THE COMMIT, NOT INSIDE IT. `afterApprove` is the engine's post-commit hook, which is where
   * this belongs: invalidating inside the transaction leaves a window in which a concurrent request
   * misses the cache, re-resolves from rows that have not yet committed, and caches the OLD
   * permissions again — arriving at the same stale state by a longer route. Rally's `removeMember`
   * records the same ordering rule for the same reason.
   *
   * ORDERED BEFORE THE GRAPH CALL, and outside its early return. The previous body opened with
