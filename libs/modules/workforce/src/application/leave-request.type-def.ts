 *
 * AND RECORDS THE DECISION, which nothing did. `RequestEngine` writes no audit entry for any
 * transition — it owns `request_items` and leaves the domain event to the type that defines it — and
 * these hooks wrote the status change and stopped. The only `leave.approved` / `leave.rejected` writes
 * in the codebase sat in a `// Legacy path` branch of `WorkforceService.reviewLeave` that
 * `createLeave` made unreachable the moment it started setting `requestId` on every row.
 *
 * So approving leave produced no audit entry at all, on a service whose own docblock calls these "the
 * decisions people are paid on". Expiry was worse: `onExpire` cancels somebody's leave request with no
 * record that anything happened, and no actor to attribute it to.
