/**
 * Leave and overtime decisions leave a record — every one of them, including the ones nobody made.
 *
 * `RequestEngine` writes no audit entry for any transition: it owns `request_items` and leaves the
 * domain event to the type that defines it. These two type-defs wrote the status change into the
 * domain table and stopped, so approving leave produced NO audit row at all. The only
 * `leave.approved` / `overtime.approved` writes in the codebase sat in a `// Legacy path` branch that
 * `createLeave` and `createOvertime` made unreachable the moment they started setting `requestId`.
 *
 * WHY A UNIT SPEC AS WELL AS THE E2E. Two of the six hooks are `onExpire`, reached only when a cron
 * finds a request past its deadline. Driving that end to end means manufacturing a three-day-old
 * request and running the sweep; here it is a direct call. The e2e proves the rows reach the database,
 * this proves each hook asks for the right one — including the two an e2e would skip.
 *
 * The load-bearing assertions are about ATTRIBUTION, not merely presence: who the entry names, and
 * whether it can be told apart from the neighbouring event that writes the same status.
