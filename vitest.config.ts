      // matters: no test was removed from surviving code. The deleted relay and
      // aws-client.config were better covered than the repo average, so removing them and
      // their specs together lowered the mean while leaving every remaining line as tested as
      // before. `pnpm check:coverage-floors` fails in BOTH directions — it refused the raise
