     * people are asked to trust, and every bug report would then start by asking which
     * rows were fixtures. Nothing in `infra/` sets this variable today, which is
     * exactly why now is the cheap time to add the floor.

     * Deployed migrator tasks run with `NODE_ENV=production` and nothing else does —
     * CI's ephemeral Postgres and a developer's machine do not — so the floor cannot
     * block a legitimate local or CI seed. Ported from rally, whose develop database
     * really did carry a fixture project for a while.
