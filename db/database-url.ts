/**
 * Single source of truth for the Postgres connection URL.
 *
 * Two ways to supply it, checked in this order:
 *
 *  1. DATABASE_URL — a complete URL. Used by local dev, CI, and anything with a
 *     static credential. Returned untouched.
 *
 *  2. DATABASE_HOST / PORT / NAME / USER / PASSWORD — composed here.
 *     This is the deployed path. Host/port/name are plain (non-secret) env vars
 *     from Terraform; user and password are injected by ECS straight from the
 *     RDS-managed secret via its `:json-key::` selector.
 *
 * WHY THE SPLIT EXISTS
 *
 * RDS is created with `manage_master_user_password = true`, so AWS owns the
 * password and rotates it on its own schedule, storing it in an AWS-managed
 * Secrets Manager secret. This app previously read a SEPARATE, hand-populated
 * `db-url` secret holding a copy of that password. Every rotation silently
 * invalidates such a copy, and the next deploy dies with
 * `28P01 password authentication failed for user "app_admin"` — with nothing
 * drifting in Terraform to hint at why. Rally hit exactly that and removed the
 * copy; this is the same fix, before the first rotation rather than after.
 *
 * Composing from parts removes the copy entirely. ECS reads the managed secret at
 * task start, so a rotated password is picked up by the next task without a human
 * touching anything. It also keeps the password out of Terraform state, which is
 * what would happen if Terraform built the URL itself.
 *
 * It is also what makes least-privilege roles possible at all: while the whole
 * credential arrives as one opaque URL there is nothing to point at a different
 * role, so api and worker cannot connect as anything but the master user.
 *
 * ROTATION CAVEAT: credentials are injected at task START. If AWS rotates while
 * tasks are running, already-open connections survive but new ones fail until the
 * task restarts. That is inherent to ECS secret injection, not to this helper.
 * The task health check surfaces it and the service replaces the task.
