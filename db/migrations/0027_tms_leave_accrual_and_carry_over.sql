-- ============================================================================
-- Migration 0027: leave accrual over time, and carry-over between years
-- ============================================================================
-- WHAT THIS DOES NOT ADD, AND WHY
--
-- No days-per-year column. `workforce.leave_entitlements.granted_days` is already
-- the year's entitlement — set by HR, pro-rated by hand for a mid-year joiner — and
-- two sources of truth for "how many days" is exactly the drift the balance service's
-- own docblock warns about. So the policy decides HOW those days become available and
-- WHAT survives into the next year, and nothing else.
--
-- No accrual ledger either. Accrued-to-date is a FUNCTION of the grant, the method
-- and the date, so it is computed on read for the same reason a balance is:
-- `granted × completed months ÷ 12` cannot drift, whereas a monthly cron writing rows
-- has to fire on the right morning twelve times a year and be reconciled when it does
-- not. The one thing that IS stored is what a carry-over run decided, because that is
-- a decision rather than arithmetic.
--
-- BEHAVIOUR-PRESERVING BY DEFAULT
--
-- A leave type with no policy row behaves exactly as it did before this migration:
-- `annual_grant`, no carry-over. That is why the seed below covers only the types
-- where accrual is a real policy, and why there is deliberately NO test asserting the
-- enum is fully covered — unlike `isms.classification_levels` and its siblings, an
-- absent row here is a MEANING and not a gap.
--
-- INVARIANTS
--
-- 1. AN EXPIRY NEEDS SOMETHING TO EXPIRE —
--    `ck_leave_policy_expiry_needs_carry_over`. An expiry month on a policy that
--    carries nothing forward describes nothing.
--
-- 2. AN EXPIRY DATE NEEDS CARRIED DAYS — `ck_leave_entitlement_expiry_pair`, the same
--    rule one table down. A date on a row that carried nothing is a lie about the row.
--
-- 3. DAYS ARE NOT NEGATIVE — `ck_leave_policy_carry_over_non_negative`,
--    `ck_leave_policy_expiry_months_range`. A negative cap would make the carry-over
--    run subtract days from next year.
--
-- WHAT THE SERVICE HOLDS THAT NO CHECK CAN
--
--   * ACCRUED-TO-DATE. A function of the date, so it is not a column at all.
--   * THE CARRY-OVER CAP. The cap lives on the policy and the carried days on the
--     entitlement, so a CHECK cannot compare them; the run applies it, and re-running
--     is idempotent because it SETS the value from the prior year rather than adding.
--   * EXPIRY. Carried days stop counting once `carried_over_expires_on` has passed,
--     which is a comparison against today and therefore a read-time decision.

-- Grants
-- ============================================================================
-- `workforce` was covered by migration 0012's blanket grants and default privileges,
-- so `leave_policies` arrives with SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE for the application
-- roles. It is REFERENCE DATA, seeded above, so the write privileges are revoked:
-- accrual method and carry-over caps are policy, changed by migration and in review,
-- not by whoever holds `workforce.manage`.
--
-- Done with REVOKE and not a narrower GRANT, because the privileges attach at CREATE
-- TABLE from the default privileges — a smaller GRANT here would read like a
-- restriction and change nothing. See migration 0022.
