-- ============================================================================
-- Migration 0021: security incidents and their append-only timeline
-- ============================================================================
-- AN INCIDENT IS A RISK THAT MATERIALISED, which is why `risk_id` exists: the
-- register said this could happen and the incident proves it did. Nullable,
-- because plenty of incidents are things nobody had on the register — and
-- noticing THAT is the feedback loop, surfaced by a report rather than by forcing
-- a link nobody believes.
--
-- WHY NOT THE REQUEST ENGINE. Every other multi-step flow here is a
-- `RequestTypeDef`, and the roadmap warns against modules growing their own status
-- columns. This is the deliberate exception: the engine models an APPROVAL —
-- somebody decides yes or no, with separation of duties and an SLA on the
-- decision. Incident handling is not a decision awaiting approval; it is work
-- proceeding under time pressure, and its states are what has been ACHIEVED
-- (contained, resolved) rather than what has been permitted. Routing it through
-- the engine would require an approver for "we have contained it".
--
-- INVARIANTS
--
-- 1. TIMESTAMPS ARE PAIRED WITH STATUS — `ck_incident_contained_pair`,
--    `ck_incident_resolved_pair`, `ck_incident_closed_pair`. A `contained_at` on
--    something still `triaged` is a lie, and a `resolved` row with no
--    `resolved_at` cannot be reported on.
--
--    Each is written as an implication rather than an equivalence, because the
--    states are CUMULATIVE: a `closed` incident still carries the `contained_at`
--    and `resolved_at` it passed through. So "contained_at IS NOT NULL" is
--    required BY the later states, not forbidden to them.
--
-- 2. TIME RUNS FORWARD — `ck_incident_timeline_order`. Resolved before detected,
--    or closed before resolved, is a data-entry error rather than a state.
--
-- 3. RESOLVING NEEDS A CAUSE, CLOSING NEEDS A LESSON —
--    `ck_incident_resolution_evidence`, `ck_incident_closure_evidence`. ISO 27001
--    A.5.27 is "learning from information security incidents"; a closed incident
--    with nothing learned is the box-ticking the clause exists to prevent.
--
-- 4. `false_positive` IS TERMINAL AND CARRIES NO HANDLING TIMESTAMPS —
--    `ck_incident_false_positive`. "It turned out not to be an incident" is a real
--    outcome, and forcing it through contained/resolved would attach containment
--    times to something that never needed containing.
--
-- THE 72-HOUR CLOCK IS DERIVED IN THE QUERY, NOT STORED — and that is a
-- correction, not a preference. It was first written as a generated column,
-- `detected_at + interval '72 hours'`, which Postgres refuses:
--
--     ERROR 42P17: generation expression is not immutable
--
-- Adding an interval to a `timestamptz` is only STABLE, because the result depends
-- on the session time zone and therefore on DST; a generated column requires
-- IMMUTABLE. Rather than fight that with `AT TIME ZONE` casts, the deadline lives
-- in ONE place — the repository's overdue query — and the partial index below
-- covers `detected_at`, which is what that query filters and orders on. GDPR
-- Article 33 counts 72 hours from becoming aware, so detection is the anchor
-- either way.
--
-- THE TIMELINE IS APPEND-ONLY. `incident_events` gets no UPDATE or DELETE path in
-- the service, and the reason is evidential: a post-incident review is read by
-- people judging whether the handling was adequate, and a timeline that can be
-- quietly edited afterwards proves nothing. Corrections are new rows.
