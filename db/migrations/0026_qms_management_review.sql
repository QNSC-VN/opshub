-- Migration 0026: management review (ISO 9001 §9.3)
-- ============================================================================
-- WHY THIS MODULE IS MOSTLY A JOIN
--
-- §9.3.2 lists what a review must CONSIDER, and every item is something another
-- register already answers:
--
--   (c)(4) nonconformities and corrective actions -> the recurrence and
--          containment-overdue reports (migration 0024)
--   (c)(6) audit results                          -> the audit programme and its
--          unlinked findings (0025)
--   (c)(7) performance of external providers      -> vendor review gaps and
--          unassessed spend (0023)
--   (e)    effectiveness of actions on risks      -> the untreated-risk report (0020)
--   (a)    status of actions from previous reviews -> this migration's own action rows
--
-- So this module COMPOSES those rather than storing copies. A second copy of "how
-- many findings are overdue" would disagree with the register within a day.
--
-- WHAT IT DOES STORE IS THE SNAPSHOT
--
-- `management_reviews.inputs` is those composed reports FROZEN at the moment the
-- review was held. That is the one thing the join cannot give you: minutes have to
-- show what the numbers WERE on the day. A live re-read would silently turn "eleven
-- findings overdue" into "three" once the backlog cleared, and the decision recorded
-- beside it would stop making sense.
--
-- `jsonb` rather than columns, deliberately. The shape is a REPORT BUNDLE whose
-- members change whenever a register adds a report — three of them arrived in the
-- last three migrations — and a column per metric would mean a migration every time,
-- with every historical row backfilled to a value nobody measured. The snapshot is
-- write-once, read-as-a-whole, and never queried by member, which is exactly the
-- shape `jsonb` is for. Nothing in the application filters on its contents.
--
-- NO ATTENDANCE REGISTER, DELIBERATELY. §9.3 requires top management to review,
-- evidenced by `chair_id` and the minutes document. A full attendee roster is good
-- practice rather than a clause requirement, and `internal_audit_auditors` already
-- carries the one roster that IS load-bearing — its impartiality rule reads it. A
-- second link table nothing enforces against would be shape without a rule.
--
-- INVARIANTS
--
-- 1. HOLDING A REVIEW FREEZES ITS INPUTS — `ck_mr_held_pair`. A review recorded as
--    held with no snapshot is a meeting nobody can reconstruct, and §9.3.2 is a list
--    of things that must have been considered.
--
-- 2. CLOSING NEEDS THE MINUTES AND A CONCLUSION — `ck_mr_closed_pair`. §9.3.3 asks
--    for documented outputs; a review with none produced nothing.
--
-- 3. A CANCELLED REVIEW WAS NEVER HELD, and says why — `ck_mr_cancelled_pair`,
--    `ck_mr_cancelled_clean`.
--
-- 4. AN ACTION'S TERMINAL STATE CARRIES ITS OUTCOME — `ck_mr_action_completed_pair`,
--    `ck_mr_action_outcome_note`.
--
-- Every implication CHECK uses `coalesce(x, '')`: a CHECK that evaluates to NULL is
-- SATISFIED, so the naive spelling accepts precisely the row where the column was
-- omitted. Migration 0023 shipped that bug three times.
--
-- WHAT THE SERVICE HOLDS THAT NO CHECK CAN
--
--   * THE SNAPSHOT IS COMPOSED, NEVER SUPPLIED. No API accepts `inputs`, for the same
--     reason none accepts a risk score or a vendor's next review date.
--   * REVIEWS ARE HELD IN ORDER. §9.3.2(a) — the status of actions from PREVIOUS
--     reviews — only means something if "previous" is settled, so a review cannot be
--     held while an earlier scheduled one is still outstanding.
--   * A CLOSED REVIEW ACCEPTS NO NEW ACTIONS. An action added afterwards is an output
--     the minutes do not contain.

-- Grants

-- `qms` carries `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` from migration 0024, so both tables arrive
-- usable. Granted explicitly anyway, as 0025 does: if that default were ever reverted
-- these tables would still work rather than failing on the first insert in CI.
--
-- Nothing here is reference data, so there is no REVOKE. The snapshot is write-once by
-- convention and by the service's own API — there is no route that edits it — but the
-- row it lives on is edited throughout the review's life, so a privilege-level
-- restriction would have to sit on a column and Postgres grants UPDATE per column
-- only in a form that a future column addition silently escapes.
