-- ============================================================================
-- Migration 0023: the supplier register, due diligence, and the risks vendors carry
-- ============================================================================
-- ISO 27001 A.5.19–A.5.23 (supplier relationships) and GDPR Article 28
-- (processors). The questions, in the order an auditor asks them: who do we depend
-- on, what did we check before we depended on them, and when did we last look
-- again.
--
-- WHAT ALREADY HELD VENDOR-SHAPED TEXT, AND WHY IT IS NOT THIS
--
-- `licenses.software_licenses.vendor` (NOT NULL varchar) and
-- `compliance.software_catalog.publisher`. Neither is a vendor: they are labels on
-- a licence and on a piece of software, and "Microsoft" in eleven licence rows is
-- eleven strings rather than one supplier with one owner and one assessment
-- history.
--
-- `software_licenses.vendor_id` is added ALONGSIDE the text, not replacing it —
-- the same move `positions` made with `employees.job_title`. The text stays
-- because existing screens read it and not every line item deserves a
-- due-diligence file; the reference is what turns "what do we buy from this
-- supplier, and did anyone assess them" into a join. No backfill: matching
-- free-text names to register rows is a judgement, and guessing it in a migration
-- would silently attach spend to the wrong supplier. The anti-join report is what
-- makes the un-linked rows visible instead of forgotten.
--
-- WHY `vendor_criticality_levels` IS A TABLE
--
-- The same two reasons `isms.classification_levels` is one. The RANK cannot live
-- in the enum's declaration order — Postgres does sort an enum that way, so it
-- appears to work until somebody appends a tier and silently makes it the highest.
-- And `review_interval_months` must be stated once: the next review date is
-- computed from it when an assessment is recorded, so the cadence is policy in one
-- place rather than a number typed in per vendor by whoever fills the form.
--
-- INVARIANTS
--
-- 1. EVERY VENDOR HAS AN OWNER — `owner_id NOT NULL`, on the same reasoning as
--    `information_assets.owner_id`.
--
-- 2. AN ACTIVE PROCESSOR HAS A WRITTEN AGREEMENT —
--    `ck_vendor_processor_agreement`. GDPR Article 28(3) requires processing to be
--    governed by a contract, so a supplier handling personal data on our behalf
--    cannot be `active` without one recorded.
--
--    DELIBERATELY SCOPED TO `active`. Registering a prospective processor before
--    the agreement is signed is the normal order of events; a blanket requirement
--    would push that record-keeping outside the system, which is worse than
--    recording it early.
--
-- 3. TERMINATION IS PAIRED WITH ITS DATE AND ITS REASON —
--    `ck_vendor_terminated_pair`, the same status/timestamp pairing the incident
--    module uses. A `terminated` row with no date cannot be reported on; a date on
--    a live supplier is a lie.
--
-- 4. THE CONTRACT WINDOW RUNS FORWARD — `ck_vendor_contract_window`, fronted by
--    the shared `assertDateOrder` guard so the caller gets a code, not a 500.
--
-- 5. CONDITIONS ARE REQUIRED WHEN AN ASSESSMENT IMPOSES THEM —
--    `ck_vendor_assessment_conditions`. `pass_with_conditions` with nothing
--    written down is the outcome people pick to avoid saying no, and it is
--    worthless a year later.
--
-- Every CHECK is restated in `VendorService` as a coded refusal: a raw constraint
-- violation reaches the caller as a 500 with no error code.
--
-- WHAT THE SERVICE HOLDS THAT NO CHECK CAN. Going `active` is the act that creates
-- exposure, so it requires a CURRENT PASSING ASSESSMENT — a rule about another
-- table's latest row, which is a query rather than a constraint. It also needs the
-- `vendor.approve` permission, kept out of every role bundle exactly as
-- `risk.accept` and `information_asset.declassify` are.
