-- Migration 0020: control catalogue, Statement of Applicability, risk↔control link
-- ============================================================================
-- THREE TABLES, BECAUSE THEY ANSWER THREE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS
--
--   isms.controls      REFERENCE DATA. What Annex A contains, plus the
--                      organisation's own additions. Says nothing about this
--                      company; two organisations hold identical rows.
--
--   isms.soa_entries   The DECISION about each control — applicable or not, why,
--                      how far implemented, who owns it, when it is reviewed.
--                      That is the Statement of Applicability, the one document an
--                      ISO 27001 auditor asks for first. ONE row per control:
--                      `uq_soa_control`, because a statement that says two things
--                      says nothing.
--
--   isms.risk_controls WHICH CONTROLS TREAT WHICH RISK. Many-to-many by nature,
--                      and the join is what turns "we have controls" into "this
--                      risk is treated by these controls".
--
-- WHY NOT COLUMNS ON `controls`. Merging the decision into the catalogue would let
-- a re-seed of Annex A overwrite the organisation's justifications, and it would
-- make "which controls have we not decided about yet?" unanswerable — an ABSENT
-- SoA row is precisely that state, and a NULL column cannot distinguish it from
-- "decided, no comment".
--
-- INVARIANTS
--
-- 1. APPLICABILITY AND STATUS CANNOT DISAGREE — `ck_soa_applicability` pairs
--    `applicable = false` with `not_applicable`. "Excluded but implemented" is
--    unrepresentable rather than merely discouraged, and so is "included but not
--    applicable".
--
-- 2. A JUSTIFICATION IS ALWAYS PRESENT — `justification` is NOT NULL and
--    `ck_soa_justification_substance` requires more than whitespace. For an
--    included control it is the rationale; for an excluded one it is the exclusion
--    reason the standard demands by name. One column, because it is one
--    obligation.
--
-- NOT CONSTRAINTS, deliberately. "An implemented control should have evidence" is
-- a maturity judgement, not a data rule. Plenty of controls are implemented by
-- configuration rather than by a document, and a CHECK would push people into
-- attaching the nearest file to satisfy it. The gap report surfaces it instead.
