-- Migration 0017: employment contracts
-- ============================================================================
-- `employees` says who someone is and `employee_positions` says what role they
-- occupy. Neither says on what TERMS: whether the engagement ends, when probation
-- closes, what notice is owed, what the agreed pay is. Those are the questions HR
-- is actually asked, and none of them is answerable from a job title.
--
-- A contract is FOR a position, which is why 0016 came first. `position_id` is
-- nullable only because a contractor may be engaged for work rather than a seat.
--
-- THREE INVARIANTS HERE, ONE DELIBERATELY IN THE SERVICE
--
-- 1. ONE ACTIVE CONTRACT PER EMPLOYEE — `uq_employee_active_contract`, partial
--    unique over (employee_id) WHERE status = 'active'. Draft, expired and
--    terminated rows are unconstrained, so a renewal chain and an abandoned draft
--    coexist with the live agreement. This index is also what forces a renewal to
--    be one transaction: the incoming row cannot activate until the outgoing one
--    leaves 'active'.
--
-- 2. END DATE MATCHES TYPE — `ck_contract_type_end_date`. `permanent` with an end
--    date is a fixed-term contract mislabelled; `fixed_term` without one is
--    open-ended employment nobody approved. It reads one row, so it is a CHECK
--    rather than a service convention a seed could bypass.
--
-- 3. DATES RUN FORWARD — three CHECKs. An agreement that ended before it began is
--    a data-entry error, not a state.
--
-- NOT A CONSTRAINT, and not an oversight: "a contract may only be ACTIVATED once
-- it is signed" is a transition rule, not a property of a row. A CHECK on
-- (status='active' AND signed_at IS NOT NULL) would also forbid recording a
-- historical contract whose paperwork was never scanned. It lives in the service.

-- Migration 0012 granted `opshub_app` / `opshub_worker` access by iterating the
-- schemas that existed THEN, so every schema added later needs this block. Local
-- development cannot catch the omission — a developer connects as the owner, which
-- is exempt — but CI runs its e2e suite as `opshub_app` and fails with a 500 on the
-- first insert, which is how migration 0015 found out.
