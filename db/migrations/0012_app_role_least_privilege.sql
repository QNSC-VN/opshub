-- Migration 0012: least-privilege database roles
-- ============================================================================
-- Today the API, the worker AND the migrator all connect with the RDS master
-- credential. That single credential OWNS every object in the database, so an
-- ordinary read request runs with rights to DROP the schema it is reading.
--
-- The consequence that matters most is not the dramatic one. A table's owner is
-- exempt from row-level security unless FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY is also set, so
-- any RLS policy added later would be silently bypassed by every request — the
-- policy would exist, be reviewable, and do nothing. Moving the runtime off the
-- owner is what makes that layer possible at all.
--
-- This migration creates the roles and the grants. It deliberately does NOT
-- switch anything over:
--
--   * The roles are created NOLOGIN. They cannot connect, cannot be used, and
--     cannot lock anyone out. Applying this migration changes the behaviour of
--     exactly nothing that is running.
--   * Cutover — generating passwords, storing them in Secrets Manager, pointing
--     DATABASE_USER/PASSWORD at the app secret, and granting LOGIN — is a
--     separate, separately reviewed step. See
--     docs/runbooks/db-role-least-privilege.md.
--
-- `db/migrate.ts` already prefers DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL over DATABASE_URL, and
-- `db/database-url.ts` already composes a DSN from discrete parts, so the
-- application side needs no code change — only the credentials it is handed.
--
-- Idempotent: safe to re-run, and safe on a database where the roles already
-- exist (e.g. a developer who created them by hand from the runbook).
-- ============================================================================

-- ── Per-role statement timeouts ─────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Nothing currently bounds how long a query may run. `drizzle.provider.ts` sets a
-- connection-acquisition timeout, which is how long a caller WAITS for a pool
-- slot — not how long a query may hold one. So a single pathological query pins
-- its connection indefinitely, and the symptom is not "slow query": it is every
-- OTHER request queueing and then erroring, with nothing pointing at the query
-- responsible.
--
-- Set on the ROLE rather than in the parameter group deliberately. A cluster-wide
-- statement_timeout would also apply to opshub_migrate, and DDL on a large table
-- legitimately runs for minutes — a migration killed halfway is a far worse
-- failure than a slow request. Per-role settings are applied at connection time,
-- so the migrator keeps no limit while the two runtime roles get one.
--
-- Inert until cutover rather than wrong: where a service still connects as the RDS
-- master, none of these roles is the one connecting.
--
-- Idempotent: ALTER ROLE … SET overwrites.
