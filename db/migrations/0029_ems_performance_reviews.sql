-- ============================================================================
-- Migration 0029: performance reviews
-- ============================================================================
-- The last gap in EMS. A review is a CYCLE (the period everyone is reviewed for),
-- a REVIEW per employee within it, and the GOALS that review is judged against.
--
-- WHY A CYCLE TABLE AND NOT A YEAR COLUMN
--
-- "Who has not been reviewed yet" is the question this feature exists to answer,
-- and it is unanswerable from a year on a review row: an absent row means both
-- "not due" and "overdue", and nothing says when the window closed. The cycle
-- owns the period and the deadlines, so coverage is an anti-join against the
-- employees who have no review in it — the same shape as the competency gap
-- report, and correct for the same reason.
--
-- THE POSITION IS FROZEN, THE ASSIGNMENT IS NOT
--
-- `reviews.position_id` is copied from the employee's CURRENT assignment when the
-- review is created and never updated. A review is a judgement about how somebody
-- did IN A ROLE, so a transfer in March must not restate what December's review
-- was about. This is the opposite choice from the competency gap report, which
-- deliberately reads the live assignment — the difference is that a gap is a fact
-- about now and a review is a record of then.
--
-- RATINGS ARE A REFERENCE TABLE WITH A RANK
--
-- `rating_scale`, the fifth instance of the pattern (`classification_levels`,
-- `vendor_criticality_levels`, `nonconformance_severities`, `leave_policies`).
-- `rank` is the authoritative ordering and is NOT enum declaration order: the enum
-- is a set of names, and a distribution report that sorted by it would be sorting
-- by an accident of how the type was written.
--
-- `requires_development_plan` is the gate, exactly as `requires_capa` is for a
-- non-conformance grade. A poor rating with no plan attached is a complaint about
-- somebody rather than a decision about what happens next.
--
-- INVARIANTS
--
-- 1. NOBODY REVIEWS THEMSELVES — `ck_review_reviewer_not_employee`. The whole
--    point of the record is a second opinion; a self-review is the self-assessment
--    field, which already exists on the row.
--
-- 2. ONE REVIEW PER EMPLOYEE PER CYCLE — `ux_review_cycle_employee`. Two rows
--    would make "reviewed?" ambiguous and the coverage report double-count.
--
-- 3. A SHARED REVIEW HAS A RATING — `ck_review_rating_before_sharing`. A review an
--    employee can see with no rating on it is a form, not a review.
--
-- 4. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND ITS TIMESTAMP AGREE — `ck_review_acknowledged_pair`, and
--    the same for the self-assessment (`ck_review_self_assessment_pair`) and the
--    approval (`ck_review_approval_pair`). A status that says acknowledged with no
--    date is unusable as evidence, and a date with another status is a lie about
--    the row.
--
-- 5. A GOAL'S WEIGHT IS A REAL SHARE — `ck_goal_weight_range`, 0 exclusive to 100
--    inclusive. A zero-weight goal is one nobody is judged on.
--
-- 6. THE CYCLE'S DATES MAKE SENSE — `ck_cycle_window`, `ck_cycle_review_after_period`,
--    `ck_cycle_self_before_review`. You cannot review a period before it has ended,
--    and a self-assessment due after the review is due helps nobody.
--
-- THE NULL TRAP
--
-- A CHECK that evaluates to NULL is SATISFIED (see migration 0023), so every
-- implication below over a nullable column is written to be TOTAL: paired
-- constraints compare two `IS NOT NULL` expressions, which are never NULL, and the
-- rating gate names the statuses explicitly rather than testing the rating alone.
--
-- WHAT THE SERVICE HOLDS THAT NO CHECK CAN
--
--   * GOAL WEIGHTS TOTALLING 100. A sum across rows, so no row-level CHECK can see
--     it; enforced when the review is sent for approval, which is the moment the
--     weights stop being a draft.
--   * THE DEVELOPMENT-PLAN GATE. `requires_development_plan` lives on the scale
--     and the plan on the review — two tables, so a CHECK cannot compare them.
--   * THE STATE MACHINE. Guarded `WHERE status = <from>` on every transition, so
--     two concurrent callers cannot both move the same review.
--   * WHO MAY APPROVE. The engine keeps the reviewer from signing off their own
--     submission; the type def additionally refuses the EMPLOYEE, who would
--     otherwise be able to approve their own review with `performance.approve`.
--   * CLOSING A CYCLE WITH UNFINISHED REVIEWS. A count across rows.

-- ============================================================================
-- Grants
-- ============================================================================
-- `performance` is a NEW schema, so migration 0012's blanket grants and default
-- privileges do not reach it — every schema created since has had to grant
-- explicitly, and `db/enable-least-privilege-roles.ts` now derives its schema list
-- so it fails the build if this is forgotten.
--
-- `rating_scale` is REFERENCE DATA, seeded above and changed by migration only: a
-- rating scale is a policy decision, reviewed, not typed in by whoever holds
-- `performance.manage`. Granted then REVOKEd rather than granted narrowly, because
-- the default privileges re-attach writes at CREATE TABLE and a smaller GRANT here
-- would read like a restriction and change nothing (see migration 0022).
