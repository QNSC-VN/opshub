-- ============================================================================
-- Migration 0016: job positions, approved headcount, assignment history
-- ============================================================================
-- `employees` already carries `job_title` and `department`, but both are free text
-- ON THE PERSON. They answer "what does Mai do?" and nothing else: you cannot ask
-- how many QA Engineers were approved versus filled, what a vacancy is, or what
-- the role required when someone held it two years ago.
--
-- A position is the ROLE as an entity, outliving whoever occupies it. That is also
-- what the rest of the roadmap needs: QMS competency is "training required for
-- THIS POSITION", and an employment contract is a contract FOR a position. Built
-- against `job_title` both would be matching on a string.
--
-- `employees.job_title` is deliberately NOT dropped: the Entra sync writes it and
-- older screens read it. Removing it would be a second change riding along on this
-- one.
--
-- ONE INVARIANT IN THE DATABASE, ONE DELIBERATELY NOT
--
-- 1. ONE CURRENT POSITION PER EMPLOYEE — `uq_employee_current_position`, a partial
--    unique index over (employee_id) WHERE effective_to IS NULL. History rows are
--    unconstrained, so someone may hold the same position twice across a career,
--    but never two at once. That is what makes "their position" a question with
--    one answer, and no service check can hold it against concurrent writes.
--
-- 2. HEADCOUNT IS NOT A CONSTRAINT, and that is not an oversight. "At most
--    `headcount` open assignments for this position" is a COUNT across rows
--    filtered by `effective_to IS NULL`; a unique index cannot express it and a
--    CHECK cannot see other rows. It is enforced in the service, which counts
--    inside the assignment transaction so two concurrent assignments cannot both
--    see the last free slot.

-- Migration 0012 granted `opshub_app` / `opshub_worker` access by iterating the

-- development cannot catch the omission — a developer connects as the owner, which
-- is exempt — but CI runs its e2e suite as `opshub_app` and fails with a 500 on the
-- first insert, which is how migration 0015 found out.
