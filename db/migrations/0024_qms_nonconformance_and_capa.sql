-- Migration 0024: non-conformances and corrective actions (ISO 9001 §10.2)
-- ============================================================================
-- §10.2 is one obligation in five parts: react to the nonconformity, evaluate
-- whether corrective action is needed, implement it, REVIEW WHETHER IT WORKED, and
-- record both the nonconformity and the actions taken. So the register and the CAPA
-- table arrive together: the rule that makes the pair worth having — a major finding
-- cannot be closed until a CAPA has been verified effective — needs both to exist.
--
-- WHAT THIS IS NOT
--
-- `isms.incidents` is a SECURITY event whose states are what has been achieved under
-- time pressure. A non-conformance is a failure to meet a REQUIREMENT, which may have
-- caused no event at all. They overlap often enough that `nonconformances.incident_id`
-- exists, so an incident that also breaches a quality requirement is one finding with
-- a pointer rather than a retyped copy.
--
-- `compliance.compliance_findings` is scan-detected and always about software on a
-- device (`software_name` is NOT NULL there). It feeds this register; it is not this
-- register — the same conclusion migration 0019 reached about the same table.
--
-- WHY `nonconformance_severities` IS A TABLE
--
-- The third of this shape, after `isms.classification_levels` (0022) and
-- `isms.vendor_criticality_levels` (0023), and justified the same way twice over:
--
--   * The RANK cannot live in the enum's declaration order. Postgres does sort an
--     enum that way, so it appears to work until somebody appends a grade and
--     silently makes it the worst.
--   * `requires_capa` and `containment_due_days` are POLICY, read by the closure
--     gate and the overdue report. On the severity row they are stated once; in the
--     service they would be a CASE somebody has to remember to extend.
--
-- INVARIANTS
--
-- 1. EVERY FINDING HAS AN OWNER — `owner_id NOT NULL`.
--
-- 2. A STATE IS PAIRED WITH ITS EVIDENCE — `ck_nc_contained_pair`,
--    `ck_nc_closed_pair`, `ck_capa_*`. A `contained` row with no containment action
--    describes nothing; a `verified` CAPA with no verifier is not a review.
--
--    EVERY ONE OF THESE USES `coalesce(x, '')`. `length(btrim(NULL)) >= 10`
--    evaluates to NULL, and Postgres ACCEPTS a CHECK that returns NULL — so the
--    obvious spelling passes precisely the row it exists to reject, the one where the
--    column was left out. Migration 0023 shipped that bug in three constraints and it
--    was found by probing the real table with the column omitted, not by review.
--
-- 3. `void` CARRIES NOTHING — `ck_nc_void_clean`. "Raised in error" and "contained on
--    Tuesday" are not both true.
--
-- 4. TIME RUNS FORWARD — `ck_nc_timeline_order`, `ck_capa_timeline_order`.
--
-- 5. A CAPA BELONGS TO A FINDING — `nonconformance_id NOT NULL`. A corrective action
--    with nothing to correct cannot be reported on, and nobody can tell later whether
--    it worked.
--
-- WHAT THE SERVICE HOLDS THAT NO CHECK CAN
--
--   * THE CLOSURE GATE. A finding whose severity `requires_capa` cannot be closed
--     without a CAPA in state `verified` — a statement about rows in another table,
--     which is a query rather than a constraint.
--   * SEPARATION OF DUTIES on the effectiveness review: the verifier may not be the
--     CAPA owner. A CHECK could compare the two columns, but the rule is about the
--     ACTOR performing the transition, and the owner can change between plan and
--     review. It is enforced in the service and carries its own permission.
--   * `ineffective` RETURNS TO `analysis`. A CHECK cannot see the previous state.
