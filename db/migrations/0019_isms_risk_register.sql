-- ============================================================================
-- Migration 0019: ISMS risk register and treatment plans
-- ============================================================================
-- `compliance.compliance_findings` is shadow-IT specific — `software_name` is NOT
-- NULL and every row is something a scan detected. A risk is the opposite kind of
-- object: deliberately identified by a person, scored, owned, treated or accepted,
-- and reviewed on a cadence. Findings are INPUTS to risks, not risks.
--
-- SCORING IS GENERATED, NOT WRITTEN. `inherent_score` and `residual_score` are
-- `likelihood * impact` computed by Postgres, so the register cannot hold a row
-- whose score disagrees with its own factors — not by convention, by construction.
-- The seed and any fix-up script get it right for free, and the register's default
-- ordering is an indexed column rather than a recomputed expression.
--
-- INVARIANTS
--
-- 1. FACTORS ARE 1..5 — `ck_risk_inherent_range`, `ck_risk_residual_range`. A
--    5x5 matrix is what the policy documents; a 7 in one column silently changes
--    what every threshold in the register means.
--
-- 2. RESIDUAL IS BOTH OR NEITHER — `ck_risk_residual_pair`. A half-scored
--    residual is not a score, and the generated column would be NULL anyway,
--    which would then read as "not assessed".
--
-- 3. RESIDUAL CANNOT EXCEED INHERENT — `ck_risk_residual_not_worse`. Treatment
--    reduces risk or leaves it alone. A residual above inherent means the two
--    were entered the wrong way round.
--
-- 4. ACCEPTANCE IS ACCOUNTABLE — `ck_risk_accepted_evidence`. `accepted` requires
--    who, when and why. ISO 27001 asks exactly that, and a boolean answers none
--    of it. The approval itself is the request engine's, linked by
--    `accepted_via_request_id`.
--
-- 5. CLOSURE IS EXPLAINED — `ck_risk_closed_evidence`. A risk that left the
--    register with no reason is indistinguishable from one somebody deleted.
--
-- NOT A CONSTRAINT, deliberately: "a treated risk must have a residual score" is
-- a rule about the TRANSITION, so a CHECK cannot express it without also
-- forbidding a legitimate `identified` row that has no residual yet. It lives in
-- the service, alongside the guarded WHERE clause that makes it race-safe.
