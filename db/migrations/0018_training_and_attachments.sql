-- ============================================================================
-- Migration 0018: training records, and the attachment plumbing they need
-- ============================================================================
-- TWO THINGS, and they are one change: training certificates are the first
-- upload surface that ACCUMULATES, so the storage layer has to grow a link table
-- before the domain that needs it can exist.
--
-- PART 1 — storage
--
--   * `stored_files.checksum_sha256` — the client's base64 SHA-256, recorded at
--     presign and compared on confirm. Size alone cannot catch a same-length
--     substitution. Nullable: nothing enforces a checksum at PUT time and the
--     four surfaces that predate this column never declared one.
--
--   * `storage.attachments` — the link between an owning entity and its files.
--     `stored_files.linked_entity_type/id` already existed but is single-valued
--     cleanup bookkeeping, not ownership: one file, one entity, forever. That was
--     enough while every surface was 1:1 and kept its key on the domain row
--     (`employees.photo_storage_key` and friends), which is why those surfaces are
--     deliberately NOT migrated here — their key column IS the relationship.
--     Polymorphic on (entity_type, entity_id) following rally's `work.attachments`;
--     `entity_id` carries no FK because it cannot point at two tables, and that is
--     the standing cost of the shape. `file_id` cascades.
--
-- PART 2 — training
--
-- "Mai did fire safety in March" is a fact about a person. The questions actually
-- asked are about the ORG: which courses must a QA Engineer hold, who is missing
-- one, whose certificate lapses this quarter. The requirement lives on the
-- POSITION, not the person — the ISO 9001 / 27001 competency framing — so three
-- tables: the catalogue, what each position requires, and who completed what.
--
--   * ONE CURRENT RECORD per (employee, course) — `uq_training_record_current`,
--     partial over rows that are neither superseded nor revoked. Retraining must
--     accumulate; two rows both claiming to be the live answer must not.
--
--   * `records.expires_on` is FROZEN at completion from `courses.validity_months`.
--     Recomputing on read would restate history every time somebody edited the
--     course, which is the same reason a leave request freezes its day count.
--
--   * NO expiry sweep, deliberately. Unlike a contract, a lapsed certificate
--     changes nothing about what may happen next — it is a report, and
--     `expires_on < today` answers it without a job that can fall behind. The
--     `revoked`/`superseded` states are decisions somebody made, and those ARE
--     stored.

-- Migration 0012 granted `opshub_app` / `opshub_worker` access by iterating the
-- schemas that existed THEN, so every schema added later needs this block. Local
-- development cannot catch the omission — a developer connects as the owner, which
-- is exempt — but CI runs its e2e suite as `opshub_app` and fails with a 500 on the
-- first insert, which is how migration 0015 found out.
--
-- `storage.attachments` is a NEW TABLE IN AN EXISTING SCHEMA, so the default
-- privileges 0012 set would cover it only if the creating role matches. Granted
-- explicitly rather than relying on that.
