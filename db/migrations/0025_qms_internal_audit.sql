-- Migration 0025: internal audit engagements (ISO 9001 §9.2)
-- ============================================================================
-- WHY THE FINDINGS ARE NOT A TABLE HERE
--
-- An audit finding IS a non-conformance. `qms.nonconformances.source` already
-- carries `internal_audit`, and §9.2.2(e) — action without undue delay — is the
-- CAPA machinery migration 0024 built. A separate `audit_findings` table would
-- duplicate the grade, the containment, the closure gate and the CAPA link, and the
-- two copies would immediately disagree about what "closed" means. So the audit
-- gains a pointer FROM the register and nothing else.
--
-- `nonconformances.internal_audit_id` is NULLABLE and is NOT required even when
-- `source = 'internal_audit'`. A finding written up during fieldwork before the
-- engagement row exists is the normal order of events for a small team, and a
-- blanket requirement would push that record-keeping out of the system. The gap is
-- a REPORT instead — the same reasoning as the risk register's unlinked incidents
-- and the vendor register's unassessed spend.
--
-- WHAT §9.2 ASKS FOR, AND WHERE EACH PART LIVES
--
--   (b) define the CRITERIA and SCOPE of each audit — both NOT NULL with substance
--       CHECKs. An audit with no stated criteria cannot be repeated or defended, and
--       "we looked at purchasing" is not an audit scope.
--   (c) ensure OBJECTIVITY and IMPARTIALITY — `internal_audit_auditors`, plus the
--       rule enforced in `CapaService`: somebody who audited may not sign off the
--       effectiveness of a corrective action arising from their own finding. That
--       one is a statement about rows in three tables, so no CHECK can hold it.
--   (d) REPORT results to relevant management — the `reported` state, requiring a
--       conclusion AND the report document to reach it.
--   (f) RETAIN documented evidence — rows are never deleted. `cancelled` records an
--       audit that did not happen, and says why.
--
-- INVARIANTS
--
-- 1. EVERY AUDIT HAS A LEAD — `lead_auditor_id NOT NULL`, and the service also
--    writes the matching `lead` roster row inside the same transaction so the
--    column and the roster cannot disagree.
--
-- 2. A STATE CARRIES ITS OWN EVIDENCE — `ck_audit_started_states`,
--    `ck_audit_reported_pair`, `ck_audit_closed_states`, `ck_audit_cancelled_pair`.
--    Every one uses `coalesce(x, '')`: a CHECK that evaluates to NULL is SATISFIED,
--    so the naive spelling accepts precisely the row where the column was omitted
--    (migration 0023 shipped that bug three times).
--
-- 3. REPORTING IS NOT OPTIONAL BEFORE CLOSURE — `ck_audit_closed_states` requires
--    `reported_at`. An audit closed without its results reaching management has not
--    been done, whatever the status column says.
--
-- 4. TIME RUNS FORWARD — `ck_audit_timeline_order`.
--
-- 5. THE PLANNED WINDOW RUNS FORWARD — `ck_audit_planned_window`, fronted by the
--    shared `assertDateOrder` guard so the caller gets a code, not a 500.
