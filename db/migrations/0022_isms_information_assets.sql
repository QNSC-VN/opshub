-- ============================================================================
-- Migration 0022: the information asset register, classification and its history
-- ============================================================================
-- THIS IS NOT `assets.assets`. That table is the DEVICE inventory — asset tag,
-- serial number, MDM device id, warranty, and a status that runs in_stock →
-- assigned → in_repair → retired → lost. An information asset is a payroll
-- system, a customer database, a room of signed contracts. Putting the second
-- kind in the first table would mean a fabricated `asset_tag` for "Customer CRM",
-- a permanently null `serial_number`, and a status column that lies: a database
-- is never `in_stock`.
--
-- The relationship between the two is real, though, and it is modelled where it
-- exists — `information_asset_devices`. That link answers the question security
-- asks the moment a laptop goes missing: WHAT WAS ON IT. It is a table and not a
-- column because one laptop holds several information assets and one system lives
-- on many laptops.
--
-- `isms.risks.asset_id` and `isms.incidents.asset_id` are untouched and still mean
-- a DEVICE. A lost-laptop incident reaches classification through the device link,
-- so neither table needed a second nullable pointer.
--
-- WHY `classification_levels` IS A TABLE AND NOT JUST THE ENUM
--
-- Two things have to be stated once: the RANK and the HANDLING RULES. Rank cannot
-- live in the enum's declaration order — Postgres does sort an enum that way, so
-- it would appear to work, and then break silently the first time somebody appends
-- a label and makes it the highest by accident. Handling rules cannot live on each
-- asset without being copy-pasted per row and drifting.
--
-- The table is keyed BY the enum, so a level and a label are the same thing rather
-- than two lists to reconcile, and `information_assets.classification` is an FK to
-- it: a classified asset always has a rank to sort by and rules to hand somebody.
-- The one gap a constraint cannot close — an enum value with no level row — is
-- covered by a test that reads the levels back and compares them with the enum.
--
-- INVARIANTS
--
-- 1. EVERY ASSET HAS AN OWNER — `owner_id NOT NULL`. The most-audited fact about
--    an asset register, so it is a thing that cannot happen rather than a report
--    to chase. The employee's existence is checked by the service: cross-schema
--    references here carry no FK, matching `soa_entries.owner_id`.
--
-- 2. THE LABEL AND THE CONFIDENTIALITY RATING CANNOT CONTRADICT EACH OTHER —
--    `ck_information_asset_classification_confidentiality`. `public` with a
--    confidentiality rating above the floor is a contradiction in terms, and
--    `restricted` at 1 or 2 means somebody labelled it without assessing it.
--
--    ONLY THE TWO EXTREMES ARE CONSTRAINED. The middle of the scale is a
--    judgement call, and forcing an exact label-to-rating mapping would make the
--    rating a restatement of the label rather than an independent assessment.
--
-- 3. PERSONAL DATA IS NEVER PUBLIC OR MERELY INTERNAL —
--    `ck_information_asset_personal_data_classification`. `isms.incidents` keys
--    its 72-hour breach clock off this column, so it has to mean something alone.
--
-- 4. RATINGS AND RETENTION ARE IN RANGE — `ck_information_asset_cia_range` uses
--    1..5, the same scale as the risk register's likelihood and impact, so a risk
--    about an asset and the asset itself are read on one scale.
--
-- 5. A CHANGE MUST CHANGE SOMETHING, AND SAY WHY —
--    `ck_asset_classification_history_change` and
--    `ck_asset_classification_history_reason`. A row from `confidential` to
--    `confidential` is noise in the one place that must stay readable, and a
--    one-word reason is the box-ticking the history exists to prevent.
--
-- Every CHECK here is also restated in `InformationAssetService` as a coded
-- refusal: a raw constraint violation reaches the caller as a 500 with no error
-- code, which is useless to the screen that has to explain it.

-- Granted explicitly rather than relying on the `isms` default privileges from
-- migration 0019: those apply only when the creating role matches, and a mismatch
-- surfaces as a 500 on the first insert in CI rather than anything legible.
--
-- THE NARROWING IS DONE WITH `REVOKE`, NOT A SMALLER `GRANT`. Migration 0019 ran
--
--   ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA isms
--     GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO opshub_app, opshub_worker;
--
-- so every table created in this schema arrives already holding all four. Writing
-- a narrower GRANT here would have been a no-op that READ like a restriction — the
-- privileges were granted at CREATE TABLE, before this block runs. The revoke is
-- what actually removes them.
--
--   * `classification_levels` is reference data seeded above, so the application
--     keeps SELECT only. The levels and their handling rules change by migration,
--     in review — not by whoever happens to hold `information_asset.manage`.
--
--   * `asset_classification_history` is APPEND-ONLY, so it keeps SELECT and INSERT.
--     Documenting "there is deliberately no update" in the repository port
--     describes the code that exists today; withholding the privilege is what makes
--     it true of the code somebody writes next year.
--
-- The same correction is applied to `isms.incident_events` from migration 0021.
-- That table is append-only by the same argument and has only ever been INSERTed
-- into and SELECTed from, but it was left holding UPDATE and DELETE — its
-- append-only property was declared and not enforced. Leaving the two siblings
-- inconsistent would be worse than either choice made consistently.
