/**
 * Canonical permission catalogue — the SINGLE source of truth for authorization.
 *
 * This file lives in `db/` (not `libs/`) on purpose: it is the one place both the
 * standalone migrator/seed image (which bundles `db/**` only) and the NestJS app
 * (via `@shared-kernel`, which re-exports it) can import. Keeping it here is what
 * stops the seed's role definitions, the backend's `@RequirePermission`
 * decorators, and the frontend's `can()` gating from drifting apart.
 *
 * Why it exists: before this, opshub had TWO permission vocabularies. `db/seed.ts`
 * defined `asset.read` / `license.read` / `audit.read` and inserted them into the
 * database, while `libs/shared-kernel/src/constants.ts` declared a `PERMISSION`
 * const holding `assets.view` / `licenses.view` / `audit.view` — codes that were
 * never seeded and that nobody could hold. Nothing referenced the constant, so it
 * was harmless in practice and loaded in principle: one autocomplete of
 * `PERMISSION.ASSETS_VIEW` would have gated a route on a permission no role
 * grants, and the route would have failed closed for everyone but `*`.
 *
 * ⚠️  Dependency-free by design — do NOT import from `libs/` here, or the
 *     migrator Docker image (which copies `db/**` only) fails to build.
