/**
 * attachments — the link between an owning entity and the files hanging off it.
 *
 * WHY A LINK TABLE WHEN `stored_files` ALREADY HAS `linked_entity_type/id`
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Those two columns are cleanup bookkeeping: they let the orphan reaper correlate a pending row
 * with whatever was being edited. They cannot express OWNERSHIP, because they are single-valued —
 * one file, one entity, forever.
 *
 * That was enough while every surface was 1:1 and stored its key straight on the domain row
 * (`employees.photo_storage_key`, `assets.photo_storage_key`,
 * `leave_requests.document_storage_key`). Training certificates are the first surface that
 * ACCUMULATES: one completed course can be evidenced by a certificate and a transcript and a
 * score report. Adding `certificate_2_storage_key` is the shape this table exists to avoid.
 *
 * The 1:1 surfaces are deliberately NOT migrated onto this table. Their key column IS the
 * relationship — there is no list to page, no quota to enforce, and no second file to name — so
 * moving them would add a join to every avatar render in exchange for uniformity alone.
 *
 * Polymorphic on `(entity_type, entity_id)`, following rally's `work.attachments`: `entity_id`
 * carries no FK because it cannot point at two tables, which is the standing cost of this shape.
 * `file_id` DOES cascade, so deleting the file drops its links. Deleting the owning entity is the
 * owning service's job, and the reaper collects files nothing references.
