/**
 * positions schema — job positions, approved headcount, and who occupies what over time.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS WHEN `employees` ALREADY HAS `job_title` AND `department`
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Those two are free text on the person. They answer "what does Mai do?" and nothing else: you
 * cannot ask how many QA Engineers were approved versus filled, what a vacancy is, or what the
 * role required when someone held it two years ago. A position is the ROLE as an entity, separate
 * from whoever currently occupies it.
 *
 * It is also the hook the rest of the roadmap needs. QMS competency is "training required for THIS
 * POSITION", and an employment contract is a contract FOR a position — both of which need the role
 * to outlive its occupant. Building those against `job_title` would mean matching on a string.
 *
 * ASSIGNMENT IS A HISTORY, NOT A COLUMN. `employee_positions` is append-mostly with an open-ended
 * `effective_to`, so "who held this position in March" stays answerable after three reorganisations.
 * A `position_id` column on `employees` would overwrite that on every move.
 *
 * `employees.job_title` is deliberately NOT dropped. It is written by the Entra sync and read by
 * screens that predate this table, so removing it would be a second change riding along on this
 * one; the position title is authoritative where an assignment exists.
