/**
 * Grant LOGIN to the least-privilege Postgres roles, then PROVE they are not
 * over-privileged. This is step 2 of docs/runbooks/db-role-least-privilege.md.
 *
 * Migration 0012 creates `opshub_app` and `opshub_worker` NOLOGIN, because giving a
 * role a password is a deliberate cutover step, not something a migration should do
 * on every deploy. This script is that step, and it runs in two places:
 *
 *  - CI, before the e2e job, so the whole suite connects as `opshub_app` instead of
 *    the owner. Without that the split is untested: every other job connects as an
 *    owner, so a table or sequence migration 0012 forgot to GRANT would pass CI and
 *    surface only after the real cutover, as `permission denied for …` on a route
 *    nobody associated with a database migration.
 *
 *  - The deployed environments, as a one-off ECS task on the MIGRATOR task
 *    definition — the only workload holding the RDS master credential and sitting in
 *    the database's subnets. RDS is not publicly accessible and ECS Exec is off, so
 *    there is no other path in:
 *      aws ecs run-task --task-definition opshub-<env>-migrator \
 *        --overrides '{"containerOverrides":[{"name":"migrator",
 *          "command":["node","dist/db/enable-least-privilege-roles.js"]}]}'
 *
 * Idempotent: ALTER ROLE sets the password to whatever value it is given, so a
 * re-run with the same secret is a no-op, and it is safe to run before the infra
 * flag flip — the roles simply sit unused until something connects as them.
 *
 * Lives in db/ rather than a scripts/ directory so it compiles into dist/db via
 * tsconfig.migrator.json and ships in the migrator image, and so it reuses this
 * repo's DSN composition instead of re-deriving it.
