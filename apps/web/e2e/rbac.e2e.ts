/**
 * Access control, in depth — the third screen decomposed onto the kit, and the one whose route the
 * shell spec never visited.
 *
 * The roles list used to be clickable `<div>`s: no table semantics, no header, no empty state. It is a
 * real table now, which is what lets this spec assert on `row` and `columnheader` rather than on
 * class names.
 *
 * FULL LIFECYCLE, ON A ROLE IT CREATES. Creating a role is additive and safe in a shared database;
 * this then adds a permission to it and deletes it again, which is the only honest way to exercise the
 * confirm dialog and leaves nothing behind.
