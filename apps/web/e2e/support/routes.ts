/**
 * Every route the authenticated shell serves.
 *
 * KEPT IN LOCKSTEP WITH THE ROUTER by `src/test/route-coverage.ratchet.test.ts`, which reads both files and
 * fails if they disagree. A hand-maintained list that silently misses a new route is the same class of fault
 * as the bug this exists to catch: something is not covered and nothing says so.
 *
 * `/login` is deliberately absent — it is the one route that renders OUTSIDE the shell, so `gotoInShell`
 * cannot assert it and a signed-in visit redirects away.
