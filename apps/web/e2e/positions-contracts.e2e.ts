 * Positions and contracts — the first two screens for modules that had an API and no UI.

 * Both create what they assert on: a fresh database has no positions and no contracts, and the whole
 * point of these screens is that a position could not previously be created without a hand-written
 * POST.
 *
 * The contracts test also pins the ONE property that is easy to get wrong here: `compensation` comes
 * back null both when no pay is recorded and when the caller may not see it, and the UI must not
 * distinguish them. Admin holds `contract.compensation.read`, so a figure it entered must come back
 * visible — the negative direction needs a second identity and belongs in the API suite, which has one.
