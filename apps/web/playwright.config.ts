/**
 * Playwright config for the OpsHub SPA.
 *
 * Assumes the API is on :3001 (`docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`,
 * `pnpm db:migrate`, `pnpm start:dev`) and the seed data is loaded. Playwright starts the Vite
 * dev server itself, which proxies `/v1` to the API.
 *
 * Run:  pnpm --filter opshub-web test:e2e
 *
 * SERIAL, ONE WORKER. These specs create real rows through the real API, and several assert on
 * "the thing I just made appears in this list". Parallel workers would interleave writes into
 * each other's lists, and the failure would look like a UI bug.
 *
 * SHARED LOGINS, EIGHT OF THEM, unlike rally, which logs in per test. rally has to: its bearer flow
 * rotates the refresh token on every use and revokes the family on reuse, so a shared session trips
 * that protection. OpsHub's SPA holds no tokens at all — auth is an opaque `__Host-opshub_session`
 * cookie backed by Valkey, and nothing rotates it — so `global-setup.ts` signs in once PER SEAT and
 * `support/test.ts` hands each TEST one of those seats.
 *
 * A SEAT PER TEST, NOT PER FILE. The DEFAULT rate-limit tier is keyed on the user id, so the previous
 * scheme — spec files spread across four seats round-robin — balanced the load between files and did
 * nothing about the load inside one. With one worker a file runs alone, so a file's burst is one
 * identity's burst: measured at 268 requests in a single 60-second window against a tier of 200. Seats
 * are chosen in `support/test.ts` now, which is why there is one project here rather than four.
 *
 * The logins still go through the BFF route, which sidesteps the AUTH_LOGIN tier rally needs a
 * `DISABLE_RATE_LIMIT` flag for.
