/*
 * WHAT THIS SCREEN NO LONGER CARRIES
 *
 * Three status→class maps (timesheet, leave, overtime) that assigned different colours to the same
 * words the inbox and access screens were also colouring; a LOCAL `StatusBadge` that shadowed the
 * shared one of the same name; an `inputClass` string; four hand-rolled `fixed inset-0` dialogs with no
 * `role="dialog"`, focus trap or Escape; four copies of the filter strip; four raw tables (21 header
 * cells); four Details/Activity drawers; and thirteen inline `toLocaleDateString()` calls.
 *
 * `statusTone` decides which tone a word means, `StatusBadge` what a tone looks like, `Modal` owns
 * dialog behaviour, `DataTable` owns the table's states, `EntityDetailPanel` owns the drawer, and
 * `formatDate` owns dates — including the part that matters here: `startDate` is a `date` column, so
 * `new Date('2026-03-04')` was rendering as the 3rd for anybody behind UTC.
