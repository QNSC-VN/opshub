/**
 * WHAT EACH PERSONA SEES, AS DATA.
 *
 * Seven persona dashboards used to be seven components, ~500 lines of JSX that differed only in
 * which tiles and links they listed. Every one re-typed the same `<StatTile … />` and
 * `<SectionCard><DomainLink … /></SectionCard>` shapes, which is why they had drifted: the same
 * destination carried three different subtitles across three personas, "Awaiting my approval" was
 * `variant="alert"` for four of the five that showed it, and two personas called a count hook whose
 * value they never rendered.
 *
 * As data, the differences are the only thing written down and the duplication has nowhere to hide.
 * A new persona is an entry, not a component.
 *
 * `count` names a key of `DashboardCounts` rather than holding a value, because a definition cannot
 * call a hook — the page resolves it. A tile with NO count is a navigation tile: it shows a dash and
 * exists to be clicked.
