/**
 * Training and competency — the third module whose API had no screen at all.
 *
 * FIVE TABS, ONE OF WHICH EVERYBODY SEES. "My training" is self-scoped: the API keys it on the caller's
 * own id, so an employee holding no permission codes still reaches their own record and their own
 * outstanding courses. The other four need `training.read`, so they are not rendered for somebody who
 * would only get a 403 — a tab that exists to fail is worse than one that is absent.
 *
 * The tab ORDER puts "My training" first for anybody who cannot manage: the first tab is the one that
 * opens, and for most of the company that is the only one worth opening.
 *
 * COMPOSITION ONLY. Each tab is its own module for the reason workforce's four are: a page that also
 * contains three forms, five tables and a drawer is not composing anything.
