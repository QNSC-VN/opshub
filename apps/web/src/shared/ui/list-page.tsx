/**
 * ListPage — the one layout for an entity list screen.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The nine list screens in OpsHub each re-wired the same four things in their own order: a title
 * block, a search box, a table and a row count. They drifted exactly as you would expect — some
 * had a search, some had filters above the table and some below, one showed the count on the left
 * and the rest on the right, and NONE of them paginated (every page requests `limit: 100` and
 * shows a total, so any list with more than a hundred rows silently truncates).
 *
 * This composes the pieces in ONE order and owns nothing else:
 *
 *   PageHeader        — title, description, primary action
 *   toolbar           — search · filters · trailing slot
 *   DataTable         — supplied by the page, with its own columns
 *   PaginationFooter  — "26–50 of 312", from the API's `pageInfo`
 *
 * STATE LIVES IN `useListState`, NOT HERE. The search term and the offset have to be readable by
 * the page's query — that is the whole point of them — so a scaffold holding them privately would
 * force every page to lift them back out. It also means the reset-on-search rule lives in one
 * testable hook rather than in a component tree.
 *
 * NOT A COPY OF RALLY'S `ListPageScaffold`, deliberately. That one paginates CLIENT-side over a
 * fully-loaded array and owns row selection for bulk actions, because Rally's endpoints return
 * whole collections. Every OpsHub list endpoint pages server-side and none has a bulk operation
 * yet, so importing that design would mean a pager that lies about page 1 of 1 and a selection
 * gutter with nothing to do.
