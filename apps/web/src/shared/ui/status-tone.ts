/**
 * Status → tone, for the vocabularies that appear on more than one screen.
 *
 * WHY A MAP OF TONES AND NOT OF CLASSES
 * -------------------------------------
 * Twelve sites wrote the badge's Tailwind classes inline — `bg-warning-bg text-warning` and friends —
 * so the same word was a different colour on different screens: `pending` was amber in the inbox and
 * neutral on the access screen, and `high` severity was `bg-orange-50 text-orange-700`, a raw palette
 * value in a codebase whose whole point is semantic tokens that flip in dark mode. (That one did not
 * flip. It was unreadable on a dark background.)
 *
 * A tone, not a class: `Badge` owns what a tone LOOKS like, and this owns which tone a word MEANS.
 * Those are different decisions and the split is what stops a new page inventing a third orange.
 *
 * WHAT BELONGS HERE. Only vocabularies shared by two or more screens — approval statuses, severities,
 * lifecycle states. A vocabulary used on exactly one screen stays there, next to the page that reads
 * it: moving it here would make this file the place every enum in the product accumulates, and a
 * lookup table nobody can attribute to a caller is worse than a local one.

 * The request-engine decision states, and the domain statuses that mirror them.
 *
 * Shared by the inbox, access requests, workforce (leave, overtime, timesheets), catalog requests and

 * words.
 *
 * `pending` is AMBER rather than neutral: it is the state that needs somebody to act, and the whole
 * reason those screens exist is to surface it.

/**
 * Severity and risk grades, worst first.
 *
 * `critical` and `high` are BOTH red, and that is deliberate: the palette has one "this is bad"
 * colour, and splitting it into red-and-orange put a raw `orange-700` into the one screen that tried
 * — which then did not flip in dark mode. The distinction is carried by the WORD, which is why
 * `StatusBadge` always renders text and never colour alone.
 *
 * TWO PAGES USED TO DISAGREE WITH THIS. `incident.types.ts` and `vendor.types.ts` each carried a
 * byte-identical local function mapping `high` to amber, `medium` to blue and everything else to
 * neutral — so one severity had two colours depending on which screen you were looking at, and the
 * split this map exists to prevent was live on two of them. Both are gone; those pages call
 * `statusTone` like the other thirty.
 *
 * Vendor CRITICALITY comes through here too. It is a different word for the same shape of judgement —
 * how bad is this — and giving it its own colour scale would mean a reader learning two.
