/**
 * The bootstrap hands its answer to the query cache, so nothing asks for it twice.
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG. `bootstrapAuth` fetches `GET /v1/auth/me` before React mounts — it has to, because
 * the router guard cannot decide anything until the session is known — and then threw the response body
 * away after copying five fields into the auth store. `useCurrentUser` asked the API for the same
 * document a moment later, because it had no way to know the answer already existed. Measured on a
 * Playwright run over the same two spec files: 26 `GET /v1/auth/me` for 26 mounts before, 13 after.
 *
 * Every page load, for every real user, paid for that.
 *
 * The other property here is about IDENTITY: `resetBootstrap` runs on logout and must leave nothing of
 * the previous session in the cache.
