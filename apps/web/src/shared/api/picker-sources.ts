/**
 * Where an `EntityPicker`'s options come from, defined once per entity.
 *
 * Four forms need to name an employee and three need to name a course or a position. Written at each
 * call site, that is seven copies of "fetch, map to `{ value, label, hint }`, decide what the hint is" —
 * and the hint is a property of the ENTITY, not of the form: an employee is always best identified by
 * their department, a course by its code.
 *
 * SEARCHING IS SERVER-SIDE WHERE THE API SUPPORTS IT. `/v1/employees`, `/v1/positions`, `/v1/documents`
 * and `/v1/assets` all take `search` — positions only since this branch: the SPA had shipped a search box
 * for that list while the endpoint had no such parameter, so the term was dropped and the box filtered
 * nothing.
 *
 * `/v1/training/courses` still has none, so that one term filters a fetched page. Marked below, because a
 * client-side filter over one page silently stops finding things at 100 rows and must not be mistaken for
 * the real thing.

 * — justified there by Annex A being 93 controls — would silently stop finding things at the page limit.
 *
 * NO STATUS FILTER, and this one is worth stating because it is not obviously right. `/v1/risks` takes a
 * single `status`, so "everything except closed" is not expressible in one call, and `VendorService.linkRisk`
 * checks the risk's status not at all. Offering every risk therefore matches what the API will accept — and
