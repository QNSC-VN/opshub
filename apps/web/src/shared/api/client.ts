 * Cookie-authenticated middleware for the BFF flow.

 * Every request carries the opaque `__Host-opshub_session` cookie, and every
 * state-changing one echoes the session-bound CSRF token. No Authorization header, no
 * token in the JS heap.
 *
 * What this replaced, and why none of it is needed any more: a Bearer header from an
 * in-memory access token, a 401 handler that silently refreshed and retried, single-flight
 * de-duplication of that refresh, and a cross-tab Web Locks mutex so two tabs could not
 * replay the same single-use refresh cookie — which the server treats as token theft and
 * answers by revoking the entire family. The server now refreshes the token behind the
 * session, so there is nothing for the browser to coordinate and no race left to lose.
