/**
 * Raw-hex ratchet — the guardrail for the design-token migration.
 *
 * The single source of truth for colour is the token layer: `@theme` in
 * `app/styles/globals.css`, which already defines `--color-accent`, `--color-border`,
 * `--color-danger` and the rest. A raw hex literal (`#a1a1aa`, `text-[#2563eb]`,
 * `style={{ color: '#fff' }}`) bypasses that layer, and bypassing it is how a palette
 * drifts: nothing then keeps light and dark in step, and nothing reports that two pages
 * picked different greys for the same meaning.
 *
 * Unlike rally's, this baseline is NOT zero. opshub has not done the migration — the
 * literals here are hard-coded Tailwind palette values (`#a1a1aa` is zinc-400, `#2563eb`
 * blue-600, `#ef4444` red-500) sitting in chart-heavy pages. Freezing the count is worth
 * doing on its own: it stops the number growing while the migration is pending, which is
 * the entire value rally's docblock claims for it.
 *
 * NEVER raise this number. If a genuinely new palette colour is needed, add it to the token
 * layer in globals.css and reference it — that is the migration, one file at a time.
 *
 * What the migration still needs, and why it is not attempted here: the remaining literals
 * are mostly chart series and SVG paint, which cannot read a CSS custom property directly.
 * rally solved that with a typed mirror of the tokens (`shared/config/brand.ts`) that charts
 * import. opshub has no such mirror yet, so there is nowhere for those values to move to —
 * and changing colours is visually consequential, so it wants someone who can see the
 * result rather than a mechanical edit.

// ── Ratchet baseline — LOWER as files migrate, NEVER raise ────────────────────
//

// wrong place, and a baseline above the real count is slack a ratchet cannot have.

/**
 * Files that define colour in hex BY DESIGN, so every consumer can read from them instead of
 * re-hardcoding. Kept explicit and justified rather than a broad glob, so it stays auditable
 * and cannot silently hide scattered hex.
 *
 * Empty today: opshub has no palette-definition layer in TypeScript — its tokens live in
 * `globals.css`, which this scanner does not read. Add an entry here only for a file that IS
 * the source of truth for its values, never to quiet a violation.
