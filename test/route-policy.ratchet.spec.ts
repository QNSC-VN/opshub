/**
 * Ratchet: every HTTP route handler must DECLARE how it is authorized. Baseline 0.
 *
 * This used to be a debt counter at 43, because `PolicyGuard` returned `true` on missing
 * metadata: a handler nobody decorated was allowed, to any authenticated caller. `JwtAuthGuard`
 * proved *who* you were and nothing then checked *whether you may*, so forgetting a decorator
 * was not a 500 and not a 403 — it was a silently world-readable endpoint that every test
 * still passed.
 *
 * The guard now denies an undeclared route, and `assertEveryRouteDeclaresAuthz` refuses to
 * finish bootstrapping when one exists. So this is no longer a debt marker: it is a static
 * fast check for a property the runtime also enforces, and it stays because a source-text scan
 * runs in milliseconds and names the file and line, while the boot audit needs a module graph.
 *
 * FIVE declarations satisfy it, and every route has exactly one:
 *   `@RequirePermission(code, scope?)`   a permission, resolved from the database
 *   `@Public()`                          no principal exists yet (login, refresh, HMAC webhook)
 *   `@SelfScoped(reason)`                the subject IS the caller
 *   `@AuthorizedInService(reason, test)` resolved at run time, pinned by a named test
 *   `@AuthzGap(reason)`                  a KNOWN missing check, counted below
 *
 * `@Auth()` is NOT one of them. It mounts JwtAuthGuard and nothing else, so treating it as
 * authorization would make this ratchet report zero while changing nothing about who may call
 * what — which is exactly the state that produced the 43.
 *
 * This scanner reads SOURCE TEXT. It cannot tell a correct permission code from a misspelled
 * one, and it cannot see authorization that lives inside a service — `@AuthorizedInService`
 * routes satisfy it by declaring, not by being checked here. That is why a ratchet is a smoke
 * detector and the e2e and unit suites are the authorization tests.

// ── Baseline — LOWER as routes get decorated, NEVER raise ─────────────────────
//
// 46 when the scanner was written; 43 after the three `employees/:id/avatar/*` routes were
// decorated. Note what did NOT move it: the six workforce routes fixed in the same change
// are still counted, because their authorization lives in the service (bucket 3). A
// falling count is evidence of decorators added, never of authorization added.
//
// Raising this number is forbidden. If you are here because your change made the count
// rise, the fix is to decorate the route, not to edit this line. The ONE shape that could
// justify a rise is authorization MOVING INTO A SERVICE because no decorator can express
// it — and then the move must be pinned by a test asserting BOTH directions, and named in
// the docblock above.
//
// This baseline is a DEBT MARKER, not a target: it exists so the unpoliced surface stops
// growing while the remaining routes are closed one module at a time.

/**
 * Routes carrying `@AuthzGap` — a DECLARED missing check. MAY ONLY FALL, and is now 0.
 *
 * It was 6 for one commit: the request engine and the access-request module built their WHERE
 * from optional filters, so an unfiltered call returned every row, and their by-id reads had no
 * ownership check at all. Declaring them was how they stopped being invisible among 43
 * undecorated routes; `request.read` and `ActorScope` are how they were closed.
 *
 * At 0 this is the real assertion: `@AuthzGap` exists, so a future known hole can be shipped
 * deliberately, but doing so has to raise this number in review rather than pass silently.
