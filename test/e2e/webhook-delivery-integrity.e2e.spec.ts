/**
 * A webhook delivery cannot outlive the subscription it was queued for.
 *
 * `messaging.webhook_deliveries.subscription_id` was `NOT NULL` with no foreign key — not in the
 * drizzle schema and not in any migration — while `WebhooksService.delete` hard-deletes the parent
 * row. Deleting a subscription therefore left its deliveries behind, pointing at an id that no longer
 * resolved.
 *
 * NOTHING REPORTED THEM, which is what made this worth a migration rather than a note.
 * `WebhookRelayService` claims work with an INNER JOIN onto `webhook_subscriptions`, so an orphan
 * simply stops being selected: `pending`, `attempts = 0`, forever. Never retried, never dead-lettered,
 * and invisible to the `outboxDeadLetter` alarm, which watches the dead-letter field rather than the
 * pending queue. The table grows and the operator sees nothing.
 *
 * WHY THIS SPEC EXISTS RATHER THAN TRUSTING THE MIGRATION. A constraint is only as good as its
 * presence in the database the app actually talks to, and a schema declaration cannot prove one: a
 * `.references()` in drizzle does nothing at runtime here, because migrations are hand-written. So
 * this drives the real API and then asks the real database what happened.
 *
 * Prereqs: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d` and `pnpm db:seed`.
