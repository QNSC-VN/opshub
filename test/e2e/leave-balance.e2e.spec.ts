/**
 * Leave entitlement, balances and the holiday calendar, end to end.
 *
 * WHAT THIS EXISTS TO PIN
 * -----------------------
 * Leave used to be approvable without anyone knowing what it cost: `leave_requests` held two dates
 * and nothing else. The rules added here are all invisible from a single request row, so each one
 * needs a flow to prove it:
 *
 *   - a request costs WORKING days — weekends and public holidays excluded
 *   - that cost is FROZEN at submit, so a holiday declared later does not restate it
 *   - PENDING requests count against the balance, or an employee with two days left can file four
 *     two-day requests before anyone approves the first
 *   - a leave type with no entitlement row is UNTRACKED, not zero-allowance
 *   - only `workforce.manage` may change an allowance or the calendar
 *
 * Named by the `@AuthorizedInService(..., 'leave-balance.e2e.spec.ts')` declaration on
 * `GET /workforce/leave/balance`, which is a promise that this file asserts both directions.
 *
 * DATES ARE FAR IN THE FUTURE AND UNIQUE PER RUN. The database is shared with the other suites and
 * is not reset between them; `hasOverlappingLeave` refuses a second request across the same dates,
 * so fixed dates make a spec that passes once. The same mistake cost a debugging round in the
 * Playwright leave journey.
 *
 * Prereqs: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d` and `pnpm db:migrate`.
