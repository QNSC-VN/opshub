/**
 * Offboarding removes privilege, and leaves evidence that it did.
 *
 * `OffboardingTypeDef.onApprove` performs the five removals that end somebody's access — status,
 * roles, access grants, hardware, sessions — and it recorded NOTHING. Not `role.revoked`, not
 * `access_grant.revoked`, not `asset.unassigned`. Every one of those events is audited when a person
 * does it by hand, because the services that own those tables write the entry; this hook writes the
 * tables directly and so wrote no entry. An access-removal review saw a leaver whose privileges had
 * vanished with no record of who removed them or when — on the single path where that evidence matters
 * most, and the one ISO 27001 A.8 asks about by name.
 *
 * It also never invalidated the permission cache. `AuthzService` holds a resolved permission set for
 * 300 seconds, so for up to five minutes after being offboarded a leaver's requests were still
 * authorised against roles they no longer held.
 *
 * WHY AN E2E AND NOT ONLY THE UNIT SPEC. `offboarding.type-def.spec.ts` asserts the calls against a
 * mocked recorder, which proves the code asks for an entry. It cannot prove one ARRIVES: the resource
 * types and the brand-new `session.revoked` action have to survive `AuditService.recordChange` and the
 * repository insert, and a bad pair fails at runtime, not at compile time. So this drives the real
 * workflow over real HTTP and then reads the real audit log back.
 *
 * IT OFFBOARDS A THROWAWAY EMPLOYEE, NEVER A FIXTURE. Offboarding a seeded fixture would revoke its
 * sessions and roles for every spec that runs afterwards — the same cross-spec pollution that makes
 * `performance.e2e.spec.ts` fail on a database other specs have already touched.
 *
 * Prereqs: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d` and `pnpm db:seed`.
