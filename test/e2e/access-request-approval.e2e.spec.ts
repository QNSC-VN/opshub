/**
 * End-to-end proof that approving an access request SUCCEEDS and reports what happened.
 *
 * This exists because the flow was broken and nothing noticed. Approving a request through
 * the engine advances one step of a multi-step workflow, and an intermediate step issues no
 * grant — the request stays `pending` for the next approver. `AccessRequestService.approve`
 * was nevertheless declared `Promise<AccessGrant>` and ended by querying for a grant row
 * that does not exist yet, so it returned `undefined`, the controller read `grant.id`, and
 * the endpoint answered **500 on an approval that had in fact been applied**. A caller saw
 * a server error for a successful action.
 *
 * Why the existing tests missed it, and why this one is shaped the way it is: the unit specs
 * mock the engine, so `engine.approve()` resolving is all they can see, and the reviewer
 * guards (403 on self-approval, 404 on an unknown id) were both correct — the two ENDS of
 * the flow were covered and the middle was not. Only a real request through the real
 * controller, with the real engine deciding there is no grant yet, reaches the defect.
 *
 * TypeScript could not have caught it either: `const [row] = await query` is typed `T`
 * rather than `T | undefined` without `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`.
 *
 * Prereqs: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d` and `pnpm db:seed`.
