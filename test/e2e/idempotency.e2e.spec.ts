/**
 * Idempotent retries end to end: a repeated mutation happens once.
 *
 * WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS. `IdempotencyInterceptor` was registered globally, correct, and unreachable —
 * `Idempotency-Key` was missing from the CORS `allowedHeaders`, so a browser preflight refused the
 * request before it was sent. Nothing sent the header, nothing documented it, and nothing tested it, so
 * a feature the code implied the API had was one it did not have.
 *
 * WHAT THIS EXISTS TO PIN
 * -----------------------
 *   - THE SAME KEY PERFORMS THE WRITE ONCE. Asserted against the REGISTER, not just against matching
 *     response bodies: two identical responses would also be produced by two successful creates with
 *     the same reference, if the reference were not unique. The row count is the fact that matters.
 *   - A REPLAY SAYS SO. `X-Idempotent-Replayed: true` distinguishes "your retry was absorbed" from "I
 *     did it again", which is the difference a client needs to decide whether to trust its own state.
 *   - THE SAME KEY WITH A DIFFERENT BODY IS REFUSED, not answered. Serving the first response would
 *     report success for a create that never happened — and the caller cannot tell, because it gets a
 *     201 and a plausible object.
 *   - WITHOUT A KEY, NOTHING CHANGES. The negative control: two requests, two rows. Without it, a
 *     no-op interceptor would satisfy every assertion above by never being involved.
 *   - A FAILED REQUEST STAYS RETRYABLE. A refused create must not cache its own refusal, or one bad
 *     minute becomes 24 hours of the same bad answer under that key.
 *
 * PER-IDENTITY SCOPING IS NOT TESTED HERE, deliberately. Keys are client-generated, so two callers can
 * pick the same uuid and must not share a namespace — but the cache key is not observable through HTTP,
 * and the only end-to-end version of the assertion I could write ("a second identity's request does not
 * 500") proved nothing about scoping. It is asserted in the unit spec, where the key is an argument.
 *
 * REFERENCES ARE UNIQUE PER RUN — `uq_asset_tag` is global and the database is shared with the other
 * suites, so a fixed tag makes a spec that passes once.
 *
 * Prereqs: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`, `pnpm db:migrate`, `pnpm db:seed`.
 * VALKEY MUST BE UP: the interceptor degrades to "just perform the request" when the cache is
 * unavailable, so without it these tests would fail rather than silently pass — which is the right way
 * round, and the reason the first test asserts the replay header rather than only the row count.
