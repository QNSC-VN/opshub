/**
 * End-to-end proof that one employee cannot read another employee's HR records.
 *
 * This is the e2e counterpart to `workforce-access-narrowing.spec.ts`, and it exists
 * because that unit spec mocks the repository. It proves `narrowToActor` computes the
 * right FILTER; it cannot prove the filter reaches SQL, that the guard chain lets the
 * self-service caller through, or that the route wires the actor in at all. Those are the
 * three places the original bug actually lived — the controller never passed an actor.
 *
 * `route-policy.ratchet.spec.ts` cannot see any of this either: these six routes carry no
 * decorator and are still counted as unpoliced, deliberately. So this file is the only
 * check that runs the real guard chain, the real permission resolution and real SQL
 * against a real Postgres.
 *
 * Every assertion is made in BOTH directions. "Employee X gets a 403" is worth little on
 * its own — a route that is broken for everyone also produces it. Each case pairs the
 * denial with the same request succeeding for the tier that should be allowed.
 *
 * Prereqs: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d` and `pnpm db:seed`.
