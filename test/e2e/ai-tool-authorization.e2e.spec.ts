/**
 * The AI assistant's tools are the security boundary, and this is the test that says so.
 *
 * `POST /ai/chat` declared `@SelfScoped("the caller's own conversation; no other user's data is
 * reachable")`. The conversation was indeed the caller's; the data was not. `search_employees`
 * selected from `employees` with no predicate, `get_compliance_findings` returned every open finding,
 * and `get_active_access_grants` answered for any employee id — so any authenticated caller could ask
 * the assistant to enumerate staff, standing privileged access, and open security findings.
 *
 * WHY NOTHING CAUGHT IT. `@SelfScoped` satisfies both the boot-time route audit and
 * `route-policy.ratchet.spec.ts`, because each checks that a route DECLARES an authorization mode,
 * not that the declaration is true. The system prompt did say "respect access boundaries" — an
 * instruction to a language model, which is not an access control. Static analysis cannot close this;
 * a test that runs the tools can.
 *
 * WHY THIS DRIVES `executeTool` AND NOT `POST /ai/chat`. The route needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and a
 * real model round trip to decide which tool to call. A boundary whose only exercise is a paid API
 * call is a boundary nobody runs in CI, so `executeTool` is public and this spec calls it with the
 * real `AuthzService` and the real seeded permissions. The route's own declaration is what points
 * here, and `route-policy.ratchet.spec.ts` asserts this file exists.
 *
 * Prereqs: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d` and `pnpm db:seed`.
