/**
 * End-to-end proof that one action produces exactly ONE audit entry, and that an entry which
 * shares its mutation's transaction commits with it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * 40 of 80 audit calls lived in controllers, duplicating a call the service already made for
 * the same event, so a single action wrote two rows. The worst shape was a pair that used the
 * SAME action name: `POST /employees` wrote `employee.created` twice against one
 * `resource_id`, which reads as the employee having been created twice — something the API
 * cannot do. Measured before the fix, not inferred.
 *
 * WHY NOTHING CAUGHT IT
 * ---------------------
 * The unit specs assert `audit.record` WAS CALLED, with a mocked AuditService. Two layers
 * each calling it once satisfies every one of those assertions — a mock cannot count rows in
 * a table. Only a real request that then reads `audit.audit_logs` can see a duplicate, which
 * is why this spec queries the database directly rather than trusting a spy.
 *
 * The ratchet (`test/audit-write.ratchet.spec.ts`) stops a controller audit call being ADDED.
 * This proves the ones removed are actually gone from the output.
 *
 * NO POLLING ANY MORE, AND THAT IS THE POINT. This file used to need a `settledEntriesFor` helper that
 * waited for two identical readings, because `void audit.record(...)` resolved after the response and a
 * reader could legitimately see nothing yet. Every service write now shares its mutation's transaction, so
 * the entry is visible exactly when the change is, and reading straight away is what makes a regression to
 * fire-and-forget observable rather than tolerated. Visibility alone is not proof of atomicity — the
 * rollback case below is — but a poll would have hidden the difference either way.
 *
 * Prereqs: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d` and `pnpm db:seed`.
