/**
 * Controlled documents, end to end: draft → approve → publish → acknowledge → supersede.
 *
 * WHAT THIS PINS, AND WHY EACH NEEDS A FLOW
 * -----------------------------------------
 *   - an AUTHOR cannot approve their own policy (separation of duties, enforced by RequestEngine
 *     rather than by this module — so this proves the wiring, not a local `if`)
 *   - approval does NOT publish: a policy is routinely approved before it takes effect, and
 *     collapsing the two makes "which revision was in force on this date" unanswerable
 *   - publishing SUPERSEDES the previous version, atomically, and at most one version is ever in
 *     force
 *   - acknowledgement is per VERSION: publishing v2 makes it outstanding again for everyone who
 *     had acknowledged v1. This is the ISO requirement and the single most common way the feature
 *     is built wrong, so it gets the longest test here
 *   - acknowledging twice is one acknowledgement
 *
 * Named by `@AuthorizedInService(..., 'controlled-documents.e2e.spec.ts')` on the submit route,
 * which is a promise that this file checks the approval path in both directions.
 *
 * A UNIQUE DOCUMENT CODE PER RUN. `uq_document_code` is unique and the database is shared with the
 * other suites without a reset between them, so a fixed code makes a spec that passes once — the
 * same mistake that cost a debugging round in the leave specs.
 *
 * Prereqs: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d` and `pnpm db:migrate`.
