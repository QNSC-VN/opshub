/**
 * Approving leave and overtime lands a real audit row.
 *
 * `RequestEngine` audits no transition, and both type-defs wrote the domain status and stopped — so
 * approving leave produced no audit entry anywhere. The only `leave.approved` / `overtime.approved`
 * writes lived in a `// Legacy path` branch of `WorkforceService` that `createLeave` and
 * `createOvertime` made unreachable the moment they started setting `requestId` on every row. Two
 * decisions "people are paid on", in that service's own words, went unrecorded.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS ALONGSIDE `decision-audit.type-def.spec.ts`. That spec asserts the calls against a
 * mocked recorder, which proves each hook ASKS for an entry. It cannot prove one arrives: the action
 * and resource strings have to survive `recordChange` and the repository insert, and a bad pair fails
 * at runtime rather than at compile time. So this drives the real routes and reads the real log back.
 *
 * Prereqs: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d` and `pnpm db:seed`.
