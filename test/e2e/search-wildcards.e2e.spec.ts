/**
 * `?search=%` must find nothing, not everything.
 *
 * Thirteen repositories interpolated the search term straight into a LIKE pattern, so `%` and `_`
 * kept their wildcard meaning inside the VALUE. Both styles parameterized, so this was never an
 * injection — but `?search=%` became the pattern `%%%` and matched every row in the table, and a
 * reader searching for a literal underscore got matches unrelated to what they typed. Every reference
 * code in this product contains an underscore.
 *
 * WHY AN E2E. `search.spec.ts` proves the pattern is escaped and `search-escaping.ratchet.spec.ts`
 * proves nobody hand-rolls one, and neither proves the DATABASE now agrees. The escape character has
 * to be the one Postgres treats as an escape by default — get that wrong and the pattern is escaped
 * for a dialect nobody is running. Only a real query answers that.
 *
 * Prereqs: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d` and `pnpm db:seed`.
