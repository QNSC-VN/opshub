/**
 * A route that acts on ONE ROW should say which row, so a constrained grant can be evaluated.
 *
 * `@RequirePermission('asset.write', { resource: 'asset', from: 'param', field: 'id' })` is the full
 * form. The descriptor is what lets `ResourceScopeResolver` load the row and hand `ScopeEvaluator` an
 * owner, a team and a department to compare a `self`/`team`/`dept`/`region` grant against.
 *
 * WHAT THE GAP ACTUALLY IS, because it is the opposite of what it looks like. `AuthzService.check`
 * FAILS CLOSED: a holder whose grant is constrained, on a route that declares no scope, is DENIED and
 * a warning is logged naming the missing descriptor. Its own docblock explains why — the code used to
 * `return true` there, so a grant recorded as "asset.write @ team=X" was enforced as global. So an
 * undescriptored route is not an escalation.
 *
 * It is the reverse: the scoped-grant feature is INERT on these routes. `scope_type` is a five-value
 * enum, `POST /authz/assignments` accepts and validates `scopeType` + `scopeId`, and the row is
 * stored — and then every route without a descriptor refuses that holder. An operator can grant
 * "asset.write @ dept=Engineering" through the supported API and watch it do nothing except produce
 * 403s.
 *
 * 154 of the 161 row-scoped routes are in that state, which is why this is a BASELINE and not a
 * requirement. Adding 154 descriptors is a per-route judgement about which resource and which field,
 * and some of these routes are global by nature — a `dept`-scoped `rbac.manage` is not a thing anyone
 * wants. The number is here so the gap is counted rather than invisible, and so it cannot grow while
 * the routes are closed a module at a time.
 *
 * WHY NOT THE SIBLING REPO'S FIX. Rally makes the descriptor a REQUIRED overload parameter, so
 * omitting it is a compile error rather than something a test notices. That works there because its
 * permissions are split by TIER — workspace-wide versus project-scoped — and the requirement attaches
 * to the project tier. opshub has no tier: the same `asset.write` gates `POST /assets` (no row exists
 * yet) and `POST /assets/:id/retire` (one row). A required parameter would have to be satisfiable on
 * a collection route, where there is nothing to point at. The type system cannot express "row-scoped"
 * here without first inventing the tier, so this counts instead.
 *
 * __dirname, not import.meta.dirname: this suite runs as CommonJS.
