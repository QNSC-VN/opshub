/**
 * Every presign and confirm route carries the UPLOAD rate-limit tier. A floor, not a count.
 *
 * A presign hands out a signed S3 PUT and a confirm issues a HeadObject, so both cost object-storage
 * requests rather than database time — which is exactly why `RATE_LIMIT_TIERS.UPLOAD` exists (30/min per
 * user, against the 200/min DEFAULT). Assets carried it from the start. Employee avatars, leave documents
 * and training certificates did not: the tier existed and two thirds of the product's uploads ignored it,
 * which is the kind of gap nothing notices because the endpoints still work — they are just billed at the
 * wrong tier and unprotected against a loop.
 *
 * Scans the ROUTE DECORATORS, not a count of files, so a new upload surface has to say `@RateLimit`
 * out loud. `@Get(':id/certificates/:fileId/download')` is deliberately not in scope: a download is a
 * presigned GET, cheap, and lives on read paths a UI hits per row.
