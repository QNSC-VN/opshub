/**
 * Audit-write ratchet — an audit entry must be atomic with the change it records, and must be
 * written from the layer that owns the transaction.
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG
 * --------------
 * All 80 audit calls were `void this.audit.record({...})`: fire-and-forget, outside any
 * transaction, and `AuditService.record` swallowed the failure. So a mutation could commit
 * with no entry, and nothing anywhere would say so.
 *
 * Worse, 40 of them were in CONTROLLERS, duplicating a call the service already made for the
 * same event. A controller cannot join the service's transaction, so those could never be
 * atomic — and because both layers wrote, every one of those events was recorded TWICE.
 * Measured, not inferred:
 *   - `POST /employees`   → 2 rows, both `employee.created`, same `resource_id`
 *   - `POST /authz/roles` → `role.created` AND the controller's old `rbac.role_created`
 *   - `POST /compliance/software` → `software.added` AND `compliance.software_added`
 * Three more pairs (timesheet, leave and overtime approve/reject) were hidden behind
 * ternaries, so no grep for `action: '...'` found them — the typed catalogue did, as compile
 * errors.
 *
 * TWO NUMBERS, BOTH FALLING
 * -------------------------
 * `CONTROLLER_AUDIT_SITES` is an allowlist: each remaining entry is a controller whose
 * service counterpart does not exist yet, so moving the call needs a service method first.
 * An allowlist rather than a count because whoever adds a controller audit call has to name
 * it, which is the judgement a reviewer needs.
 *
 * `FIRE_AND_FORGET_BASELINE` is a plain count that may only fall. The remaining sites are in
 * services whose repositories do not accept a `tx` yet, so converting them is a repository
 * signature change per module rather than a one-line edit — tracked separately, and this
 * number is how progress is measured.
 *
 * 55 → 18: every SERVICE has been converted — identity, assets, access-requests, catalog, license,
 * compliance, authz-admin and workforce. Their repository mutations take an optional `tx` and each service
 * wraps the change and its entry in one transaction. What stays outside one is named at each site: Valkey
 * session revocation, an S3 delete, and the `RequestEngine` submissions where the engine owns the only
 * write and there is no transaction of ours to join.
 *
 * The 18 that remain are the 15 in the allowlisted controllers above, `AuditService`'s own write, and two
 * more in the same controllers — all blocked on a service method that does not exist yet, not on this
 * pattern.
