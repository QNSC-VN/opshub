/**
 * Query-ordering ratchet — every ORDER BY must be a TOTAL order.
 *
 * `ORDER BY x` where `x` is not unique leaves tied rows in an order SQL does not define.
 * Postgres returns whatever the scan yields, and an UPDATE that relocates a tuple to
 * another page silently changes it. Under `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` pagination that is not a
 * cosmetic wobble — rows are duplicated onto one page and dropped from every page.
 *
 * Measured on this schema before the fix, with 30 audit rows sharing one `occurred_at`
 * (what a batch insert produces) and one concurrent UPDATE between page fetches:
 *
 *     no tiebreaker  -> returned=30  distinct=25  duplicated=5  never_shown=5
 *     with tiebreaker-> returned=30  distinct=30  duplicated=0  never_shown=0
 *
 * So a user paging through audit logs, assets, employees or notifications while anyone
 * edits a record never sees 5 of 30 rows, and no error is raised anywhere.
 *
 * `LIMIT 1` is affected too, and more subtly: `.orderBy(desc(scoreDate)).limit(1)` with
 * tied dates returns an ARBITRARY row among them, so "the latest snapshot" is whichever
 * tuple the scan reached first.
 *
 * The rule enforced here: the final argument of every `.orderBy(...)` is a unique column —
 * a surrogate `id`, or a column that is itself a primary key or uniquely indexed.
 * Redundant on a sort that is already unique, and free: Postgres never compares the
 * tiebreaker unless every preceding key is equal.
 *
 * Baseline is ZERO and must stay there. The fix is always to append the tiebreaker, never
 * to add an exemption.

/**
 * Columns that are unique WITHOUT being called `id`, so ending on one is already a total
 * order. Each is a primary key or carries a unique index — checked in db/schema, not
 * assumed:
 *
 *   - `permissions.key`   PRIMARY KEY (db/schema/authz.ts)
 *   - `roles.key`         uniqueIndex('uq_role_key')
 *   - `attachments.fileId` part of PRIMARY KEY (entity_type, entity_id, file_id)
 *                          (db/schema/storage.ts, migration 0018)
 *   - `classificationLevels.code` PRIMARY KEY (db/schema/isms-information-assets.ts and
 *                          migration 0022: `code information_classification PRIMARY KEY`).
 *                          The table's `rank` is UNIQUE too, so ordering by rank alone is
 *                          already total — `code` is appended anyway so the total order rests
 *                          on the primary key rather than on a constraint a reader has to
 *                          go and find.
 *   - `vendorCriticalityLevels.code` PRIMARY KEY (db/schema/isms-vendors.ts and migration 0023:
 *                          `code vendor_criticality PRIMARY KEY`). Same shape as the classification
 *                          levels above, and `rank` is UNIQUE there too.
 *   - `nonconformanceSeverities.code` PRIMARY KEY (db/schema/qms.ts and migration 0024).
 *   - `managementReviews.reference` uniqueIndex('uq_management_review_reference')
 *                          (db/schema/qms.ts, migration 0026). Unconditional, like `roles.key`: the
 *                          index is on the column alone, so any ordering ending on it is total.
 *   - `internalAuditAuditors.auditorId` part of PRIMARY KEY (internal_audit_id, auditor_id)
 *                          (db/schema/qms.ts, migration 0025). CONDITIONAL in the same way
 *                          `attachments.fileId` is, and for the same reason: unique only WITHIN one
 *                          audit, and listed here because the only query ordering by it filters on
 *                          `internal_audit_id` first. A future query ordering by `auditor_id` across
 *                          audits would be exempted by this entry and should not be — order such a
 *                          query by the audit column too, or it is genuinely partial.
 *
 *   - `performanceRatingScale.rank` UNIQUE constraint `ux_rating_scale_rank`
 *                          (db/schema/performance.ts, migration 0029). Unconditional: the constraint
 *                          is on the column alone, so ordering the five-row scale by rank is total.
 *                          The scale is deliberately ordered by RANK and never by `code`, since the
 *                          enum's declaration order is not the scale.
 *   - `performanceGoals.title` uniqueIndex('ux_goal_review_title') on (review_id, title)
 *                          (db/schema/performance.ts, migration 0029). CONDITIONAL, exactly as
 *                          `attachments.fileId` and `internalAuditAuditors.auditorId` are: unique
 *                          only WITHIN one review, and listed because the single query ordering by it
 *                          filters on `review_id` first. A future query ordering goals by title
 *                          across reviews would be exempted by this entry and should not be.
 *
 * The reference-table entries are the same pattern: a REFERENCE TABLE keyed by its enum, carrying a `rank` column
 * and the policy that rank implies. They are enumerated individually rather than matched by a naming
 * rule on purpose — an entry here is a claim about a specific schema, and a pattern match would
 * exempt the next table that merely happens to have a `code` column.
 *
 * Extending this list is a claim about the SCHEMA. Verify the constraint exists before
 * adding one, because a wrong entry here silently exempts a broken query.
 *
 * `attachments.fileId` carries a CONDITION worth stating, because it is weaker than the other
 * two. It is unique only WITHIN one `(entity_type, entity_id)` pair — the same file may be
 * attached to two different entities — and it is listed here because every query in
 * `entity-attachments.service.ts` filters on both of those columns first, which makes the
 * remaining ordering total. A future query that orders by `file_id` WITHOUT pinning the entity
 * would be exempted by this entry and should not be: order such a query by the entity columns
 * too, or it is genuinely partial.
