/**
 * Keeps the coverage floors in `vitest.config.ts` honest.
 *
 * The floors are a ratchet in intent — the config says "Raise these as suites are added —
 * never lower them" — and nothing enforced it. So they drifted: the comment claimed
 * "floors set just below current coverage" and cited ~16% while actual coverage had reached
 * 22%, leaving 5-8 points of slack on every metric. With that much slack a third of the
 * suite can be deleted and `pnpm test:cov` still passes, which is the opposite of what a
 * floor is for.
 *
 * Adapted from rally's `coverage-include.spec.ts`, which guards the same class of bug in the
 * shape rally has it: a hand-enumerated `include` list that silently rots. opshub's include
 * is a glob, so that exact ratchet would pass forever and prove nothing — the drift here is
 * in the thresholds instead.
 *
 * Two directions, both of which matter:
 *
 *  - a floor ABOVE actual means CI is already broken (vitest fails the run anyway, but this
 *    reports it as the configuration error it is rather than a mystery);
 *  - a floor more than `MAX_SLACK` points BELOW actual means the floor has stopped
 *    protecting anything, and the fix is to raise it in the same commit that raised
 *    coverage.
 *
 * Pure functions so the checker itself is unit-tested — a drift check that is wrong reads
 * exactly like a passing one.
