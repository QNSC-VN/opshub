/**
 * Path-parameter validation ratchet — every id in a route must be validated before it
 * reaches the database.
 *
 * Why this exists: 49 of 62 `@Param()` sites had no pipe, and each one was a reachable 500.
 * A malformed id went straight into a query and came back as
 * `invalid input syntax for type uuid`, which the filter surfaced as
 * `INTERNAL_ERROR` — an unhandled server fault any authenticated caller could trigger with
 * a typo, and noise that buries real errors in the log. Found by driving the API by hand;
 * no test could see it, because no test sent a bad id.
 *
 * This is an ALLOWLIST, not a count. A count tells you the number went up; an allowlist
 * makes whoever adds a route say out loud that their parameter is not an id, which is the
 * only judgement a reviewer actually needs to check.
 *
 * ParseUUIDPipe accepts uuidv7 — verified against a live route before adopting it, since
 * every id opshub mints is v7 (`newId()`). Do not "fix" a v7 rejection that is not happening.
